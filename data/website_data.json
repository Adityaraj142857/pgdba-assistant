Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Maunish Shah December 22, 2015 Reply Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? pgdbaunofficial December 16, 2015 Reply There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. sarthak aggarwal December 29, 2015 Reply sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Mbs January 1, 2016 Reply What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 ankit gupta January 12, 2016 Reply can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Venkatesh January 16, 2016 Reply Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta ; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur . PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

It was a crisp Friday morning and I was seated comfortably in the plush IIMC library. The PGDBA semester was well underway, assignments were raining thick and fast…life was busy…life was good and I was brimming with excitement. I had only just begun working on a competition, which had started 4 days ago on June 14th 2016. It was an inter-university data-science competition called the Data Science Game . With so many constraints such as limited number of submissions in a day and final selection of only one team from a college, it was, by all means the “big deal” and a glance at the list of competing universities showed us some tough nuts. There were the usual suspects i.e. Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford et al., supplemented by a host of premier universities from across the world. Certainly our team of four from first-ever batch of PGDBA, though no novices, were far from being among the best in the world… or were they? And so we – Team Tabs – prepared a starting output, clicked on the ‘Make Submission’ button and waited with a muted yet expectation-laced anxiety that any Kaggler worth his salt would be familiar with and then this image popped up on our screen: Most authors describe moments like these with the cliche ‘There was a moment of silence followed by….’ I discovered that they were quite wrong…as my uncontrollable Hagrid-like laughter filled the breadth of the IIM Calcutta library, defiant of the several bemused yet stern glares that were pointed in my direction! Second in the whole world! Irrespective of its ephemerality, irrespective of the pains required to maintain it or the challenges that we were about to face in the coming three weeks – it was a moment of reckoning for us, a moment to cherish, a moment to savour. Yet, when I look back I can say with certainty that it was at this point I started believing that international glory wasn’t beyond our reach. What followed were some of the most gruelling days of my life. Over the next three weeks, we went on to learn and implement Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithms for image classification. We travelled to multiple universities in a quest for servers to run these algorithms. We learnt, we toiled, we toiled hard and we thrived. When the competition ended, we were the top team from India – Yes! Our hard work and perseverance led to us being the Rank 1 Indian team . We were among the 20 teams from around the world selected to travel to Paris for the final phase of the competition and folks, as you read this article, we’re on the flight journey towards the finals of the competition in Paris, to be held on 9th September. What fills me with even more delight is that not just us, but three teams from India have made it to the final 20 – one each from IIM Calcutta-Team Tabs, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata- The Frequentists (in their ranking order). India has made its presence felt in this 2nd edition of Data Science Game and interestingly enough, all the three institutes are what together constitute PGDBA! It is encouraging to see that three Indian teams have proved themselves worthy of being the global top 20 when 146 teams from 28 countries participated and showed their mettle in this grueling competition. The competition contained an image classification problem. A set of images were given, which had to be classified into four categories. The problem at hand could have been done in various ways. We decided to use deep learning as a lot of interesting work is being done around it and it’s one of the most advanced techniques currently available. We had a basic knowledge about it and developed more understanding as we moved along. The process of compiling and executing codes went on and we worked hard every single day. The machine learning algorithms take time to execute and with limited computing power at our disposal and time constraint of the competition, we ensured that every iota of it was used. As we were fighting neck to neck with all top notch universities across the world, the task was not at all easy and there were a lot of hurdles on the way. The limited computing power slowed us down. Every iteration of the code required a whole day and thus constrained our capacity to experiment with the algorithm. Soon other teams caught up with us on the leaderboard. To wrinkle out the problems we went to IIT-KGP and ISI to gain server access. However, the terminals at both places were preoccupied. As a last resort, we decided to use Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was difficult to set-up because of the complex technicalities and as none of us was acquainted with the process, it made our job all the more difficult. We quickly took charge and read about it from the scratch, spending a precious time of 3 days to figure everything out and get it running. In hindsight, it was worth the effort. Our first run in AWS increased the accuracy by 5 % and it all paid off with the jump on the leaderboard. Now that we look at it, a lot of edge was given to us by our PGDBA curriculum. The basics of machine learning and computing were well laid out throughout the course. It enabled us to deep dive into deep learning and comprehend the technical aspects around it. We also consulted with professors for guidance. With Team Tabs standing at 12 in global rankings, we realize that we have learnt a lot on the way, when we were actually working on the problem statement. We will now be competing with some of the top Kagglers in the finals. The finale would certainly provide us with global exposure as we will get a macroscopic view of what’s happening around the world in the field of data science by interacting with top-notch data analysts spread across the world. Since it’s a 2-day competition, the dynamics of the game is bound to change. We haven’t been able to put in continuous concentrated efforts towards the final round owing to the rigorous academic curriculum this semester and us coping up on classes. We do have a lot to cover but we will keep learning new stuff as we have been doing in the past year. Thus a great opportunity for knowledge transfer and networking lies ahead. With everyone’s hopes in us, we make our journey to Paris, where the final leg of the competition awaits… along with our fateful turnout in the 2nd Data Science Game competition.

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date August 27, 2016 No Comments on The Best Laid Schemes, of Spiders and Men! What do entropy, linear programming and Riemann surfaces have in common? Puzzled? Now imagine this connection explained by an eccentric speaker in the attire of a French stage magician, with the charm and virtuosity of a storyteller. Cedric Villani, French mathematician, Fields Medal awardee in the year 2010 and famously called by the NewYorker magazine as the ‘Lady Gaga of Mathematics’ delivered a public lecture titled ‘Of Triangles, Gases, Prices and Men’ at ISI on 26 th August 2016. The second PGDBA batch, currently in its first semester here at ISI, had the opportunity to be present at this intriguing and informative session. Cedric Villani The abstraction and intrigue of Cedric could be assumed from the fact that an introduction to him included a reference to the number of his pets. This abstraction could also be inferred from the title of his talk, which was a play on the title of John Steinbeck’s famous classic ‘Of Mice and Men.’ The first slide of his presentation was taken from Tennyson’s Lady of Shalott. In Cedric’s own interpretation, the Lady of Shalott, accursed to see the world only through a mirror, was actually an allegory to the mathematician forever accursed to look at reality through his equations! Cedric then said that there are many more unsolved mysteries in Mathematics today than there were a hundred years ago. There are ever so many new problems that keep arising. Then there are those age-old ones that lie in famous mathematicians’ lists of unsolved problems. One such famous unproved hypothesis is the Riemann hypothesis. This led Cedric down the path to explaining Riemann’s works and then to the first part of the evening’s presentation – ‘triangles’. He introduced to the audience Riemann surfaces and how Escher employed curved surfaces in his art. As examples of negative curvatures, he showed images of art installations in museums and models of coral reef. Einstein, with the help of his mathematician colleagues, used Riemann’s ideas to develop his General Theory of Relativity. Cedric went on to add that, the GPS technology so ubiquitous in the world today has its roots in Riemann’s works in topology. In a humorous turn of speech, Cedric noted that Riemann was as oblivious to his work being of practical use in 21 st century devices, as modern day GPS users were to Riemann’s surfaces. An ironic symmetry indeed! At this turn of his presentation, Cedric spoke about how it is equally important for scientists to pursue inspiration and not just utility. He marked out Riemann as someone who was particularly interested in approaching problems in his own unique way. Cedric quoted Poincare who had once said, “Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.” The second part of his talk on ‘gases’ started with a description of his visit to Vienna and a search for Boltzmann’s grave. He said that he stopped to ask a family for a map not expecting them to know Boltzmann, let alone his grave. To his surprise, he was not only directed to the location of the grave but the person also exclaimed Boltzmann’s equation of entropy, “S=klogW”! In connection with entropy, he then talked about the Gaussian curve, its ubiquitous nature and its uncanny appearance in many natural systems. He called the study of Probability and Statistics as ‘the extraordinary adventure of mastering of chance.’ As a matter of coincidence, he discussed a famous problem in his presentation called ‘Buffon’s needle’, which was also discussed in class earlier on the same day with the PGDBA students by their lecturer. Experiments such as coin tosses, Cedric said, are best done in the most careless ways! Then he explained how gases are modeled as billiard balls in collision and when there are many such sufficiently small billiard balls, their velocities are accurately modeled as the Gaussian distribution. As a note, Cedric remarked on the power of this distribution by quoting Sir Francis Galton who once called it the ‘supreme law of unreason.’ The next part of his presentation was ‘prices’. Cedric introduced Leonid Kantorovic, the father of linear programming. He explained how math is used to model the optimal allocation of resources. He then strung together ideas from the optimized distribution of resources to the distribution of gas molecules with the least loss of energy. The analogy of prices in linear programming is energy in distribution of gas molecules. This is where Cedric began piecing everything together with the last part of his talk called ‘men’. Cedric described how he had happened to meet his collaborators John Lott and Felix Otto. These men put together the ‘triangles’, ‘gases’ and ‘prices’ and helped Cedric complete his research on how fast gases reach the equilibrium stage described in Boltzmann’s equation. Cedric was awarded the Fields medal in connection with this research. What would have been an intimidating subject matter coming from volumes over volumes of text, was aptly introduced in a two-hour lecture by Cedric Villani, a master at his trade, a storyteller par excellence, a dinosaur catcher in his childhood dreams and a true ambassador of modern mathematics. In a surprising irony of sorts, apart from the many hidden mysteries in the details of his works, the most apparent mystery is the brooches of spiders that he wears on the lapels of his coat! Categories Articles Technical Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge Post author By pgdba_admin Post date January 31, 2016 1 Comment on Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge A brief overview on how I approached a real world healthcare problem via Analytics. Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

So, Madhur Modi is back with yet another compilation of interview experiences of some of our batchmates. This article reflects the diversity of our batch and hopefully the interview experiences shared here will provide the selected aspirants a peek into the kind of questions they are going to face. Happy Reading!! Sailesh Mohanty , B.Tech in Electronics and communications with 3 years of experience in Banking and financial services and an excellent quizzer “I had my interview on the first day so I answered about the separate written test which was held for everyone during the process. There were questions on probability and Bernoulli process, distributions and questions related to formulae. I was also asked about my job experience which primarily focussed upon customer analytics and acquisition. I had left my job and travelled places which I described vividly along with blogs I wrote during the time. The interview also covered current affairs with my opinion about topics related to net neutrality (which was a trending topic at that time) .” ****** Loveleen Kaur , a fresher in electrical engineering “I had applied using my GRE score and my interview led to questions about my decision to pick this course over general management. There were a lot of HR questions including my introduction and family background. I also faced technical puzzles such as how to increase sales of a petrol pump. Other technical questions were focused on probability, linear algebra and calculus. It was a short interview with questions based on topics on my areas of interest.” ****** Niten Singh , B.Tech in electrical engineering with 4+ years of experience in IT industry “My experience is in databases ERP systems. The interview covered questions about my job experience and HR topics. Technical questions were mainly around basics of probability and probability density functions. He also asked about distributions and limit and continuity. I answered what would be my expectations from the course, the work culture of different companies I have worked in, statistics and its uses. It was a diverse interview with a lot of focus on statistics” ****** Subhra Sardar , B.Tech in IT with around 2.5+ years of software experience and an awesome designer “I have worked on Mainframe computers which hold relevance in analytics so my interview focused on how they are currently prevalent in the industry and how they are slowly migrating to other systems. I also faced technical questions which were based on probability, statistics and permutations. There were times when I faced difficulties solving but the panelists were kind enough to provide me small hints which were enough to find the solution. My interview slot was the last one of the day yet it took 30 minutes to complete. However, the interview was focused both on my job and technical skills.” ****** Hitesh Dundi, a fresher with B.Tech in EEE “I had a 30-minute-long, quite formal interview. I faced general knowledge based questions, with technical questions mostly based on calculus and coordinate geometry and other topics such as binomial theorem. Since I am a fresher, I was also asked questions about my subjects in college.” ****** Ramakrishna Ronanki , a mechanical engineer with around 4 years of manufacturing experience “My interview focussed on my introduction, job experience. They also asked why I wanted to join the course. They delved deep into the topic and also discussed my background and startup which my brother started. There were mathematical questions such as on functions, probability and definition with examples of basic topics such as mutually exclusive events. The interview also covered the questions around the written test which we gave during the interview process” ****** Akshay Naik , a fresher in computer engineering “My interview was mainly focused on college related topics including my project which happened to be based on education analytics. Thus my interview was skin deep focused on analytics and college project. I also answered technical questions on statistics and time series. Sometimes I could not answer completely but the panelists gave hints using which led to the solution. Project related questions covered use of statistics in the project, tools and software, sponsors. I was also asked about R programming language and many project specific questions. Technical questions were also based on quadratic equations and binomial theorem, simple and compound interest.” ****** Chandra Bhanu Jha, a mechanical engineer with 11 months of IT experience and a talented guitarist “They asked about job description, my profile and college. Even with only 11 months of experience, the panelist questioned exhaustively on my job including job specific questions (physics simulations and SHM, its assumptions and characteristics and physical significance). Another major question was why analytics? I also answered queries about my undergraduate paper which was on neural networks, how they can be applied in the field of mechanical engineering.

I had to explain them the project. There were questions on Joins in SQL (some random sample data and they asked me to get a result). I remember briefly the question. Q1: There were some tickets along with their timestamp (created time stamp). Against each row, there was a column highlighting if the ticket if closed or not. Also, another columns showcasing the time when the ticket was closed. I had to find the maximum time taken by a ticket to get closed. Same for minimum. Also, how many tickets are still not closed? All using joins.Solution: Just do a left join on the ticket id and Mark the condition as closing date greater then opening date. Then calculate the difference in the time stamps (Closing-Open). Then group by functionality can be used to get the results.The discussion on this went for around 10-15 minutesKnowledge about Left Join and Inner Join was sufficient. They also made me write sub nested sub queries. The level was not very difficult. Maths/Stats questions What is correlation? Draw some examples? Basic idea about regression?

Full name Manasvi G College Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Specialization B. Tech in ECE (Avionics) Work Experience (in Months) Fresher Organization(Name) – Designation – Work Experience Background – Interview Location city Bangalore Rating interview experience (out of 5 being very good) 5 Relevant Technical/ Analytics/ML questions What is MNF transform? Why did I use MNF transform instead of a simple PCA during satellite image processing? Maths/Stats questions Since I was a fresher from the space science industry, the first interviewer asked me as to why I wanted to shift from space to business analytics. I replied saying that my interest has shifted towards business analytics when I took electives like deep learning and optimization for operations research. I also mentioned that at the same time, my ‘interest’ and ‘grades’ in electronics subjects were gradually going down. They asked me to model an equation consisting of these two variables, and they also asked me to first answer as to which variable was independent and which was the dependent variable. Initially it took me some time to understand the question during that period I explained as to how these parameters depended on various other factors. Later when I understood their point of view, I answered that interest is an independent variable and grades are a dependent variable as the grades depend on my preparation, my attentiveness in class, etc. The first panelist seemed to be very happy with my response and handed over the baton to the second panelist, who asked me questions about my internship which was based on satellite data analysis. GK/Current Affairs asked (if any) The third panelist asked me questions related to my hobby and was upset to see that I had written just three sentences for the given three blanks. He mentioned that everyone has written very short replies to hobbies. I described all the sentences in detail and they asked me about the different kinds of books I read, followed by questions about my other hobby which was teaching the lesser privileged kids. They asked me questions as to what I taught and which grade of students I taught. That shifted to languages when I mentioned that I sometimes teach in the native mother tongue so as to drive my point home and make the students understand more clearly. My next question was what are the official languages of Andhra Pradesh and then I was asked about languages of Kashmir. I took a wild guess, and also told them it was a guess. Everybody just laughed and a few guesses turned to be right while a few of them were wrong. Is the interview stressful? No Tips for Written Exam Math is the most important section. I think 11th and 12th NCERT math would be the best place to start and brush up basics and later go on to practicing advanced math problems. Data interpretation and logical reasoning are pretty straight forward, and easy to solve. Going through last year question papers would be highly beneficial as a certain trend can be observed in the question paper pattern and one can prepare accordingly. Tips to fill Application Form This is very important, especially for freshers because all the questions in the interview are going to revolve around whatever has been written in the application form. Do not forget to mention any relevant projects since they will add an edge to your profile and the interviewers can ask questions related to those projects as freshers will not have any work experience. Also fill in the hobbies section carefully and thoroughly. Personal Interview I went through the interviews of previous years and made a list of topics to study and go through. But at the end of the day, I’ve been asked questions only based on whatever I have filled in the interview application form. I think its best to be authentic and candid throughout the interview process. Also, one should have a certain clarity as to why they want to pursue this course and how it would be beneficial to them in their future. The panelists are looking for candidates who have a keen interest and passion for business analytics. If they get a feeling that you are genuinely interested and have done your homework in this field, then the chances of converting the interview is very high. Any other interaction post-interview Why business analytics and why not space industry? This has been asked by two panelists. They were probably just surprised, the second panelist realized that I already answered and then he just said congratulations and all the best.

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand. Tags Analytics , Data Sciences , Healthcare Analytics , PGDBA Categories Articles Technical A Record, a Code and Twitter Post author By pgdba_admin Post date January 20, 2016 3 Comments on A Record, a Code and Twitter How my first machine learning model was validated by a goal scored a continent away. Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century. Tags Analytics , Data Sciences , IIM Calcutta , IIT KGP , ISI , PGDBA , Student Life Categories Experiences The ISI Chapter Post author By pgdba_admin Post date January 15, 2016 1 Comment on The ISI Chapter The first semester started on July 20, 2015. The classes were held initially at the Kolmogorov bhavan. Within a month we were given our own classroom in the Satyendra Nath Bose Bhavan. Kolmogorov bhavan, ISI Our curriculum consisted of 5 subjects. The subjects and the professors involved were: Statistical inference – Amitava Banerjee Stochastic processes – Dr. Bimal Roy & Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta Computing for data sciences – Dr. Sourav Sengupta Statistical structures in data – Debashish Sengupta Database Management Systems – Dr. Pinakpani Pal & Amiya Das By far the stars of the course were the faculty members. It was an honour to interact with a Padma Shree awardee in Dr. Bimal Roy. To be taught on a regular basis by such an esteemed personality was slightly overwhelming and hugely enriching. The sheer brilliance of the man and his way of looking at probability and its applications was an experience difficult to pen down. Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta shared the course and taught Markov Chains. Satyendra Nath bhavan , ISI Campus Diligent and sincere, Prof. Debashish Sengupta was the ideal teacher. He covered every topic rigorously starting right with the basics of statistics to the highly complex multivariate analysis. What seemed an easy course initially, became heavily loaded and among the toughest by the time the course came to its completion. Tutorials were held every week to discuss exercise problems. The jovial Prof. Amitava Banerjee taught us the habit of drawing meaningful inferences out of large volumes of data. Drawing from his vast pool of consultancy experience, he inculcated in us the ability to convert real life business problems into statistical problems. His assignments involved working on datasets and testing hypothesis in the correct way. Dr. Pinakpani Pal was interactive, and worked hard to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. His course had 2 parts: the theoretical knowledge of databases, and a hands-on SQL application. He shared the course with Amiya Das, a seasoned professional at Oracle. The friendly and ever enthusiastic Dr Sourav Sengupta was always approachable and motivated the entire batch in getting accustomed with highly complex ideas. His passion for teaching shone through as he went through the concepts of linear algebra and machine learning algorithms. He organised the course superbly and the web page for his course was among the best resource repositories we could have hoped for. The invited lectures were top drawer, with experienced professionals coming in to share their insights and recommendations about the field of analytics. Overall the first semester was a learning experience beyond compare and laid a solid foundation on which we can build in our journey towards becoming well-rounded data scientists.

It is a different program than MBA. (2) Revise 11-12 Mathematics. You can start with basic book like NCERT, but also practice from a JEE main level book (RD Sharma objective book, SK Goyal or Amit M. Agarwal etc. Pick anyone of these.) Do relevant math PYQs from JEE main. (3) For DILR/VARC follow CAT material. Do CAT PYQs. (4) Definitely solve all PGDBA PYQs and take at least 5 full time mock tests. Exam pattern is different than CAT and you need to be accustomed to it.

Himanshu Goyal About the author: B. Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering from IIT Delhi – worked in Global Analytics (short-term loan provider in UK) for 5 years within collection analytics and risk analytics teams. There have been a lot of posts around the vision and scope of the program so I am not going to touch upon that for now. Instead, I am going to share my first-hand experience of the events in the first week – the orientation week – and how they affected my perception. Whenever we meet a stranger, we need an icebreaker to get things started. And that was the way the orientation week was designed. If there is one thing that repeatedly gets focussed on here at IIM-C, it is that you need to build your network. I had a fair deal of interactions with various groups. There were sessions with Deans, Program Founders, Professors, Seniors and last but not the least, multiple industry leaders. The sessions were designed to make the students more aware of the program, in terms of what the students should expect from it as well as what the professors and industries expected from its graduates. Not only did these sessions made me more informed, but I also learnt a few concepts in this week itself before the classes had even started! Interaction with Professors : There were multiple types of interactions with professors. In one of them, Deans and Senior Professors of the three institutes talked about the genesis of the program and how the geography of the three institutes fitted in perfectly to start it. It was heart-warming to see how each of them would compliment each other’s institution when their own was one of the best in its field. In another session, professors of the Organisational Behaviour course conducted a class exercise – Lost@C. While I won’t go into what it was, it would suffice to say that it was not only fun, but it also made me think on how to work better as a team. A session on how to solve case studies was organised as well. It was a very interactive session and I was encouraged to think and ask questions. All said and done, that my next 2 years were in the hands of capable professors. Interaction with Seniors : This was something each one of my batch was looking forward to. All of us had come from different backgrounds and we had questions – a significant number of them. The interaction started with introductions from both the batches. It then shifted to academic structure, the life at different campuses and the opportunities in the industry. There were a bunch of fundas from their end out of which I don’t remember much; but the key takeaway for me was that there is a huge demand in the industry for people having the right blend of technical skills and business acumen and this course perfectly bridges that gap. A large number of people have their eyes on how first few batches are performing and hence it will be up to us on how much we can push ourselves because the opportunity to gain knowledge in the three institutes is endless. Interaction with Industries : Companies were indeed looking forward to interact which was evident in the first week itself. Among them were – LatentView, PWC, KPMG, Deloitte and few others. What was striking to see was that despite belonging to diverse backgrounds, all of them had same expectations – the graduates from this course will be able to solve crucial business problems using data which will be analysed through various machine learning processes. Each of the companies highlighted the need for data scientists in today’s world because of the amount of data being generated and how it can be filled with us if we have the right mindset. It was also heartening to know that machine learning was now being applied to almost every domain (even agriculture); one just has to have an inquisitive mind to ask the right questions. I clearly remember a quote from one of such sessions, “Size of data is not the thing, but what you do with it.” Orientation day @ISI: As part of the orientation program, we also spent one day at ISI Kolkata and interacted with the professors there. At first look, ISI is an unassuming college (specially after going from IIM which has 7 lakes inside its campus!!). However, it is second to none when it comes to the faculty. One can easily find that each of the faculty is a gem by going through their profile and I cannot possible complete this article without mentioning Prof. Bimal Roy – A Padma Shri awardee, Master Cryptologist, Ex-Director at ISI – it can go on and on. He took a brief session and shared his personal experiences related to analytics. His way of telling stories really connected with me. He added a new dimension of problem solving techniques in my mind in that short session itself. . I already knew that ISI was going to play a unique role in this program because of its unparalleled specialisation in statistics and the one day spent there made me even more excited to start my studies. Given that the program is in its development stage, I had made a conscious choice and took a leap of faith while deciding to join the course. I had belief in the system, but was still apprehensive about industry expectations, and how will the institutes coordinate among themselves. These interactions, in one way or another, not only helped in soothing down my nerves but also made me even more excited and motivated to do well and make this program a success. As Abraham Lincoln once said, The best way to predict your future is to create it .

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

Madhur Modi It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds.

Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world. Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics.

There was a panel of 3 interviewers – one from each institute. Himanshu Goyal – B.Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering, 2011 , IIT Delhi; 5 years of experience in BFSI, Global Analytics Duration: 20-25 mins Questions that were asked: Tell us about your achievements Why do you want to join PGDBA Write equation for linear and logistic regression (was asked due to my background at work) A puzzle which used the property of mean A question on odds ratio and probability Experience and Review: Why PGDBA? or Why should we take you? needs to be very well prepared. You should be able to show that you are serious about this course and are making an informed choice. Everyone has a reason of their own and you will have to find one for yourself as well which you can pitch. In case you have work experience, you should be able to explain your roles and responsibilities in a comprehensive and confident way. My interview didn’t go well and I remember not being hopeful after it but my written test had gone very good which must have had a good impact. ————————————————————————– Waqar Sarguroh – B. Tech. in Chemical Engineering, IIT Roorkee, 2014; 25 months of work experience in Oil and Gas (Refinery) and EdTech Startup Duration: 20 mins Asked to explain the product of the EdTech startup that I worked for. Discussed customer segmentation based on usage of app. Asked to explain classification and clustering and explain the difference. The interviewers were very helpful as I had only an elementary idea about the concept. They walked me through the thought process by asking guiding questions. An algebraic expression of positive integers to be maximised given a constraint. (Using AM > GM) What is BRICS? What is the economic situation of BRICS countries? Did you write CAT? Why not an MBA? SUGGESTIONS-The main focus was on the ability to think through a problem. Building on ideas and communicating your thought process appropriately. ————————————————————————– Anushree Parsai – B.E. in Electronics and Communication, BITS Hyderabad, 2014; 2 years of work experience at ARM Duration: 30-40 mins As my interview questions were mostly centered around current affairs, I feel the interviewers were looking for students who were good at academics and also kept track of current events of national and international importance. They asked me following questions – Which states will be having elections this year? Do you know about GST bill? How will it help? State 3 major achievements of Narendra Modi so far? Factors responsible for Syria conflict and views on it? Based On Work experience: How are defects identified in electronic chips? Define defect and differentiate it from from fault. There was one basic question on mathematics as well on finding continuity of a function. ————————————————————————– Naveen Mittal – B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering, KNIT Sultanpur, 2016 Duration: 20-25 mins Most of the questions related to Computer Science such as complexities of algorithms, sorting, searching, N-P hard problems, etc. Also, questions from management subjects in B.Tech curriculum such as IM, IS, IP were asked. Problems were given which required basic applications of statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation etc. and drawing inferences using such measures. Calculus questions were asked, theorems such as Cauchy-Reimann, etc. were asked. Some HR questions like Why do you want to join PGDBA?? SUGGESTIONS-Be confident. Even if you do not know some of the answers don’t think that you can bluff with them. Say politely that you cannot recollect or remember the answer. I was able to answer Computer Science and Engineering related questions which happen to be my discipline during B.Tech. and maintain a positive attitude and confidence throughout the interview. ————————————————————————– Khushiram Sharma – B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering, IIT(BHU) Varanasi, 2013; 36 months of experience in BPCL as Retail Engineer and Asst. Mgr., Operations. Duration: 25 mins They asked me to briefly explain my profile of work. As I have been to many places during this time and the last one being Gorakhpur (UP), they picked a question from there. They asked me to give five cultural differences between UP & Rajasthan(I am from Ajmer) and also explain how they are different. They stopped me when I had explained four of them convincingly. They asked one question on maths which is as follows : We have identified four places in Rajasthan to be made headquarters of education for state. Out of these we have to finally select only three based on the distances need to be travelled by people in future. All other conditions will remain same for all places. Given this before jumping for any solution, I discussed about further assumptions like population density, shape can be assumed as per my drawing, people will travel to their nearest headquarter (as per straight line distance). Finally they said, all other conditions will remain same for all places. After trying for 2 minutes, they made little bit easier i.e. I have three locations and have to select two of them. Now I drew perpendicular bisectors of this triangle and then explained the solution. They asked me whether I know coding, and I said” primarily no except that I studied C language 6 years ago.” Then they asked to write a code for printing my name(string) in reverse order, which I did. I think your approach to the given problem will be a crucial factor in cracking the interview. ————————————————————————– Himanshu Jain – B.E. in Electronics and Communications Engineering, NSIT Delhi, 2013; 11 months of experience in IT Advisory (Analytics) Consultancy, KPMG; 24 months of experience in Samsung Data Systems (IT industry) Duration: 15-20 mins. P1: starts the interview asking me about my college history and Delhi Current political scenario, what I think about Arvind Kejriwal and what has changed in Delhi since AAP came to power & then asked about some Co-curricular activities. P2(IIT professor of around 40+ age) asked about my work experience as I was working in analytics field Me: I explained about my current client project and what different domains I was working on over the years. P3(one having knowledge of Statistics & maths; must be from ISI): Q1. Given a graph with a normal distribution of mean 30 marks. Also, 20% students have more than 45 marks. So how much % of students have marks ranging from 15 to 45? Q2. Asked to draw a circle and how to find the centre of a circle. I asked some questions in the end about what I can study before joining this course which would help me during PGDBA if I got selected. P2 smiled and replied just chill and enjoy. ————————————————————————– Yogesh Dewangan- B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering, NIT Raipur, 2013; Fresher Duration: 25 mins There were 3 interviewers sitting, 2 males 1 female. Interviewer (I): So Yogesh, tell me something about yourself. Me: Described a little about my background, education, then hobbies and lastly archery (I wanted them to ask on this only ). I: Oh, so you are an archer. Tell us about your achievements in archery. Do you have any certificates related to archery? Me: (showed all national and state championship certificates) I(handed over the file to another interviewer): You can have a good career in archery, then why do you want to do this course? Do you plan to continue it in future? Me: Of course sir, I am very passionate about archery. Our state does not have good facilities and environment for archery. I wish to set-up an archery academy in my state. It will have a great help to the archery community and will also attract new talents. Whatever problems I have faced as a beginner, I do not want the next generation of archers to face them. I: So have you done something in this regard? Me: Yes sir. We have formed a club and para-archery association which helps beginners and needy archers and promotes archery. I personally contribute annually to the club and I like training beginners. I: You seem to be good at maths. Can you solve a few questions. Gave two equation which I don’t remember, but were of the form x=… and y=…(quadratic in the form of x) and told me to prove that y is multiple of 9. You have a triangle of sides a, b and c. Tell me the sufficient and necessary conditions for the triangle to exist. Tell me the range and domain for x in: y = 1/(log|x|) I: Can you tell me some headlines on today’s newspaper? You belong to Chhattisgarh. What are your views about Naxalism. What they want and what you govt is doing to tackle them. Me: Told that they want to run a parallel govt and do not want govt to have any interference in their area. They follow violent route to get their demands fulfilled. Told about the kidnapping of District collector and killing of Congress leaders in 2013. Then told about govt policies and incentives about bringing Naxalites in the mainstream. FEEDBACK: Major criteria for my selection, according to me was my score in the written exam. It played a vital role. Next may be my 10th 12th percentages (both 80+). Then, interview, which I felt went well. I was able to make them ask on archery. I knew Naxalism would come and hence was prepared with it. Everything that was asked to me, I was able to answer. I would say it was totally an expected interview. ————————————————————————– Apoorv Agarwal – B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from NITK Surathkal, 2013; 30 months of experience in HealthCare Insurance, UnitedHealth Group Information Services Pvt. Ltd. Duration: 15-20 mins My interview proceeded as follows: Tell me about yourself (2 minutes) Work Experience (3-5 minutes) Q: What was your work profile? A: I was working as a database analyst in UnitedHealth Group, briefly explained about the project and my role in the company. They were more interested in analytics related work or if we were using any machine learning algorithm. Since we were not using any sophisticated machine learning algorithm at that point of time, I told him how we were doing descriptive analytics in SQL server. Probability/Statistics Questions (2-3 minutes): I was asked to write the probability density function, mean and variance of the Poisson distribution. Real life examples of Poisson and exponential distribution. Bayes Theorem – He asked me to state Bayes theorem and its application. Graduation (2 minutes) Interviewer asked me to explain the principle behind swing bowling in cricket(as I did my B.Tech in mechanical engineering and mentioned cricket in my hobbies). I explained it through Bernoulli’s effect, pressure difference and then there were a couple of questions on Bernoulli’s theorem. What motivates you to the field of analytics(2-4 minutes): As I was working in the healthcare industry, so I started with the importance of data analytics in the field of healthcare insurance, how we can reduce the overall healthcare cost and serve patients in a better way. I continued my explanation with other sectors and explained how we can leverage data analytics to make effective decisions. They wanted to check my interest in analytics. Extra Curricular Activities: Sachin Tendulkar Vs Virat Kohli- They were interested in statistical analysis behind my answer. ————————————————————————– Kapil Tripathi – B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering, NIT Allahabad, 2014; 18 months of experience in Manufacturing (Power Function), Trident Group and 5 months in a Project at BHEL Duration: 20 mins. My Complete Interview Experience – Tell me something about yourself? Q- (IIM Prof) What is your motivation for joining this programme? I told them about my start-up idea in power sector which deals purely with analytics and how this programme can help me achieve that. Q- (IIT Prof) He said these things shall not be implemented in India. Explained that how government of India has set up 1000 crores for the modernisation of electrical transmission quality and the function delivering those results shall be analytics Q- (ISI Prof) You like electrical ? Can you derive RMS value for a sinusoidal current waveform? Q-(ISI Prof) Given machines downtime periods how the spare parts in your store shall be taken care of ?

What all tools did I work on ? Why do we use SQL and not Excel for the retrieval of data. Some very basic questions on what our application was and how exactly was I contributing to the organization. Few questions were asked from JAVA and data structures too. What is cumulative frequency? They drew a graph of the cumulative frequency for the number of girls vs marks they scored and did the same for the boys and asked who performed better(girls or boys). They asked me to explain normal distribution and few trailing questions on that. They asked me about different raag as I had participated in singing events. ————————————————————————– Palash R Tatte – B.Tech. in Production and Industrial engineering, IIT Delhi, 2014; 23 months of experience in Healthcare analytics, IMS Health Duration: 30 mins Questions about my work, grilling me on fine details whenever anything regarding stats or maths was mentioned. Based on previous answer, questions about moving averages when I mentioned forecasting as a part of my work; they tried to dig deep into regression, R square (they asked me to write down its formula) It seemed they were waiting to throw hardcore math questions. But somehow discussion moved on to operations research (but be prepared for math questions, specially when you’re a fresher) and they asked me to solve a full LP problem. I tried to act smart and solved it graphically for 2 variables which did not go in my favor; they stopped me in between and asked me to do it using SIMPLEX after which I gave up. Who do you think is a better player, Kohli or Tendulkar? They asked about hobbies; on cricket, they asked whether I played any Inter IIT and which ones. They asked about my extra-curricular activities at college. Questions like if not PGDBA, then what? ————————————————————————– Kallu Chandra Mouli – B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering, NIT Trichy, 2014; 11 months of experience in FCA (Automobile industry) Duration: 30-35 mins Many questions were asked related to work experience. It began with questions like briefly explain a day in your office and questions were followed from what I answered. Few questions were asked about the tools and projects at work. One question was asked about different types of schemas implemented in databases and then types of transformations in Informatica. How would we clean data before entering them into a database . Challenges faced at work . How would you explain a flat file to your grandma. They also asked standard HR questions – Why PGDBA. What are your hobbies- I replied cycling and then we had a small discussion regarding cycle prices in India and abroad. There were very basic questions related to normal distributions. I was also asked to solve a question on permutation and combination and then one more from linear equations. Both of them were of CAT standards. I think they were looking for people with interest towards analytics and good understanding of fundamental maths and statistics. ————————————————————————– For the next part of this post: PGDBA 2016-18 Interview Experiences Part-2 Here are the links to the interview experiences of the first batch of PGDBA: PGDBA 2015-17 Interview Experiences – Part-1 PGDBA 2015-17 Interview Experiences – Part 2 Post navigation Next Article Wiser By A Semester Of Statistics Previous Article PGDBA 2016-18 Interview Experiences Part-2 Related Articles Interview Experiences PGDBA 2025-27 Interview Experiences Greetings, Future PGDBA Achievers!

To help you cope up with your preparation, we have collated the interview experiences of our current batch students. The interviews were mostly based on the profile and background of individual candidates. We hope this would be insightful and all the best! Full name Aseem Raghav College/University Delhi Technological University Specialization B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering Year of Graduation 2017 Work Experience Experienced Organization(Name) Tata Motors Limited Work Experience (in months as on Jan 31, 2020) 25 Designation Territory Sales Manager Work Experience Background Marketing/Advertising LinkedIn URL www.linkedin.com/in/aseem-raghav-a65216160 Tips to fill Application Form Questions can get asked from these sections in the PI round later as well, so be very honest in filling the hobbies, and extra-curricular description section. Tips for Written Exam Attempt previous year PGDBA question papers to get a feel of the exam format and difficulty level. There’s no one-size-fits-all kind of strategy for the PGDBA exam; you will have to tailor your preparation according to your strengths, weak areas, and the time you can manage to take out for your prep. Cutoff is usually in 100-110 (out of 150) range, but aim to score 130-140 in order to have realistic chances of conversion, as high weightage is given to written score,. Resources for exam preparation DILR – Any CAT prep material is sufficient. VARC- Any CAT prep material is sufficient. QA – “Test of Mathematics at the 10+2 Level” book by ISI comes highly recommended. You may also refer class 11-12th Maths books, for revisiting concepts and theory. Pre-interview composite score (Out of 60) 52.33 General profile based questions asked 1. Tell me something about yourself. 2. What are the qualities of a good manager? 3. What is the difference between a manager and a leader? 4. What are your strengths and your weaknesses? 5. Highlight a marketing strategy you used in your domain to your advantage. Technical questions (Analytics/ML/DS) asked None Maths/Stats questions asked Q1. What do your parents call you? In how many ways can this name be permuted? Explain this formula intuitively. A: 5! / 2! Q2. What are the types of errors in Hypothesis Testing? A: Type 1 and Type 2 error. Q3. (Gave a problem) What is the type 1 error of this problem? A: Was unable to solve, so told the panelist that i was unable to arrive at an answer, and explained my approach to him. Q4. Let’s say you want to estimate the number of Red colored Maruti Altos running in your city. How will you approach this problem? A: * The population of my city is approx. 1.8 Cr. * Let’s say there are 5 members per family. Therefore total families = 1.8Cr / 5 = 36L. * Let’s say that there is 1 car per 2 families. Therefore total cars = 36L / 2 = 18L. * Maruti Suzuki has a market share of about 50% in Delhi. Therefore total Maruti cars in Delhi = 18L * 50% = 9L * Alto has been one of the best selling cars of Maruti Suzuki. Let’s say 10% of all maruti sales have been that of Alto. Therefore total Alto cars in Delhi = 9L * 10% = 90,000 * Since Red is not a common color, let’s say only 2% of the Alto cars sold in delhi were of Red color. Therefore total red colored Maruti Alto in my city ~ 1800 cars. General Knowledge or related questions 1. What does “Aatma-Nirbhar Bharat” mean? 2.

The first question is as expected by me, introducing myself, for which, I have mentioned my academic and work background including the ML related projects, which I have done during my UG, having been prepared to answer any questions related to my ML projects but my first question came from mathematics. The panelist has given me a hypothetical scenario where I have to set up a steel plant abroad. What are the things I have to look for before selecting the place to set up the steel plant. I have mentioned the prominence of abundant water supply for steel plant, Labour laws of that state, availability of cheap labor, transportation system inside the country and export restrictions of the country. The panelist then asked a question on labor laws to which I honestly admitted that I am not much aware of it. What technical questions (relevant to Analytics/ML/DS) did the panel ask? As, I belong to civil engineering background and worked in design office, I have not been asked any ML/DL questions What Mathematics/Statistics questions did the panel ask? As I said earlier, my first question is about probability. The question is an algorithm that returns value one if the point satisfies the circle condition of unit radius for x and y. I was asked to compute the probability of getting one, for which I have computed the probability of areas ( area of circle to overall domain area of x and y). I was asked what is Poisson distribution and asked me to show the general form of Poisson distribution. A follow-up question to the same, where they asked me if there is any similarity between Poisson and Binomial distribution, for which, I have answered as the no of trials increases for a binomial distribution it would become a Poisson distribution. Another follow up question to the same is which is the limiting case? Is it the binomial the limiting case of Poisson or the other way round what is a Singular matrix?

Written Exam I was inherently comfortable with quants. So, I concentrated more on verbal part. It depends on what youâ€™re comfortable with. Also, irrespective of that, I think one should spend more time on preparing verbal part because the RCs are getting tougher year after year and they ask for any vocabulary. For para jumbles, the more you practice, the better. While preparing for verbal, make sure you cover the current affairs by reading the Hindu and editorials because thatâ€™ll help you for both the exam (vocabulary wise) and the interview because they ask anything under the sun during interviews. Pay equal attention towards LRDI and quants because thatâ€™s heavy on scoring. Even if you are not sure about any answer in the verbal part, you should be 100% accurate in LRDI and quants. Thatâ€™s how you can maximize your score above 130. Useful resources for exam preparation (if any) For Verbal and LRDI, concentrate on CAT or an equivalent material.

Tell us about yourself. 2. Why do you want to get into Analytics? 3. Why do you prefer PGDBA over many other Analytics courses? 4. It is know that PGDBA students get decent packages during placements. Is that why you prefer PGDBA? 5. According to you, what defines the success of a course like PGDBA? What technical questions (relevant to Analytics/ML/DS) did the panel ask? None. What Mathematics/Statistics questions did the panel ask? 1. Can you prove the empirical formula of measures of central tendencies? Ans. The formula is Mode = 3*Median – 2*Mean. It is only an observational result that Karl Pearson concluded after performing a large number of tests on different data. Hence, it has no mathematical proof. 2. What is the difference between local minima and global minima? I could not give a clear answer to that as they were not satisfied with the basic understanding I had about it. 3. What are the difference and the similarity between Standard Normal Distribution and Normal Distribution? Ans. Normal Distribution can have any mean and variance but Standard Normal Distribution has a mean of 0 and variance 1. The Mean, Median and Mode are all same for both distributions. (The entire panel disagreed with my answer but I did not change my answer because I knew it was right) General Knowledge or related questions (if any) 1.

Technical questions (Analytics/ML/DS) asked 1. Describe your work experience – I worked as a data analyst in the audit/assurance service line. Explained that audit requires considering each data point, and which was previously being done on a sample basis. 2. What is the typical audit data size, in terms of the number of rows and columns. 3. What tools did you use – I worked with Tableau, Python, and Alteryx. 4. What Statistical tools did you use – Talked about a few projects I had worked on, as the statistical tools varied from project to project. example: One of my projects required applying Benford’s Law, explained what it is. Maths/Stats questions asked 1a. I mentioned that I was interested in sports, and the mathematics behind it in my introduction. The interviewer asked me to give my opinion on whether the batting average in cricket is a good measure of the batsman’s ‘average’ run-scoring performance, as it does not take into account the number of innings when the batsman remained not out. – Explained that the term given for the measure can be a bit misleading if considered as an average per inning, as per my understanding, it actually is a measure of how many runs a batsman scores before getting dismissed (between two successive dismissals) 1b. The interviewer asked me to then suggest a better metric for measuring the per inning average score by the batsman. – Suggested the use of quartile scores. 1c. Can we give make a rewarding adjustment to the batsman’s score if he remains not out, comparing it with his current average performance? – Each inning is affected by a multitude of factors, rewarding on the basis of just the historical performance may not be the most optimal choice. If a reward score is given, should also penalize the batsman for getting out before his average score. 2. Give an example of numbers that have the same mean and standard deviation. – (0, 0, 0, …) will have the standard deviation 0 and mean 0. The interviewer then asked for a non-trivial solution and asked whether (2, 0) will satisfy the given condition. 3. Describe hypothesis testing, what is significance level. General Knowledge or related questions As I was from Mumbai, the interviewer asked me to explain the reasons behind farmer suicides in Maharashtra. Any other kind of questions 1. What is Assurance/Audit – Talked about the etymology of the word audit, that it meant ‘to listen’. Traditionally audit reports were given orally to an audience. 2a. I had mentioned reading as a hobby. The interviewers asked me about the last book that I had read, and what genres I was interested in. – I liked reading Fantasy, briefly described a few of my favorite fantasy books. 2b. I had also mentioned Philosophy as a genre I was interested in, the interviewer asked me how that interest was developed and what book was I currently reading. – Cognitive bias was a topic I was interested in, and how that affected rational thinking. The philosophers devoted their lives thinking and reading about their perspectives may help to improve rational thinking.

I was however prepared for Machine Learning (Andrew Ng’s Course in Machine Learning is a good starting point), SQL, Data Structures, Algorithms and Graph Theory (due to my Work Experience as a Software Engineer) Maths/Stats questions asked Statistics: Properties of PDF, f(x) for Geometric Distribution, Memoryless Property, Moment Generating Functions (and by Extension Characterstic Functions), Quasi-Random Variables [Had No Clue Regarding this during the Interview], Jacobi Method for Calculating the Probability Distributions for Functions of Random Variables, Unbiased Estimators (E(theta cap) = theta), Cramer Rao Lower Bound for Variance) Linear Algebra: Idea of Linear Transformations, Linearity Property, Matrix as a Linear Transformation, Projection as a Linear Transformation from RXRXR to RXR Calculus (Class XII): Limit for Sin(x)/x as x tends to Infinitly, Mathematical Definition of Continuity Linear Programming Problems (Class XII): Basic Definitions – Objective Function, Constraints, Feasible Regions, Feasible Solutions, Basic Variables, Bounded and Unbounded Polygons, Conditions for Unbounded Solutions [No Maximum/ Minimum] and No Solutions [Constraints with Conflicting Requirements] for Linear Programming Problems, Introduction to Simplex Method General Knowledge or related questions Since I was previously a Student and Intern in Taiwan (2017-18) and China (2018) and had attended a Volunteer Work related Conference in Bangladesh recently (2019), most of my General Awareness Questions were centric to History and Geography (but not Politics) of these Countries. China-Centric: Local Language spoken in Guangdong and Guangxi, Administrative Divisions of China (Provinces, Autonomous Regions, Special Administrative Regions, Directly Administered Municipalities), Once-China Policy, Political Parties of China and Taiwan (CCP, KMT, DPP) Bangladesh-Centric: Year of Independence of Bangladesh (1971), Trains to Bangaldesh (Bandhan & Maitree Express), the 2015 Land Boundary Agreement (& the Concept of Enclaves & Exclaves), Political Parties (BAL, BNP) Others: Capital of Pakistan prior to Independence (Karachi) Any other kind of questions Be sure to have a post interview conversation with the panelists in the form of a question (either Technical/ Non-Technical) or in the form of a remark, to close the interview on a good note.

I used Cengage. For Cengage, go through the theory part completely, try to attempt the solved question given in between along with the exercises. If you are comfortable with these questions then you can ignore the exercises at the end of each chapter. This will be more than enough to secure 100% in quant. 1 month prior the exam, join any telegram group in which people posts questions daily. This will help you immensely. For LR-DI-Verbal, use any standard CAT material. The level of PGDBA will be lower than it. In the last month try to practice at least 1 passage, 1 problem set of LR and DI each everyday. Strategy – Focus on obtaining 35 questions of quant, LR, DI correct (easily attainable). If you can secure marks around 130/150, there will be less dependency on interview marks (very random) and you will have great chances.

Tips for Written Exam VARC: The level was somewhat similar to CAT and other MBA entrance exams. One can practice from previous year cat materials or something related to that and it will be enough. There would be some para jumbles and other verbal type questions too. Plus there are no TITA type questions. DILR: It’s the easiest section in PGDBA. Almost everyone scores full here. You can check previous year PGDBA papers and you will get to know about it. If you still feel that you need practice then you can practice the very basic questions from cat sample papers. QUANT: Here one has to put a little more effort. It includes topics such as calculus, limits, continuity, conic section etc. One can say it contains almost all topics of 11th and 12th. For this one has to revise NCERT books of both 11th and 12th. Also, if one has time then he/she can practice questions from RD Sharma Objective Mathematics . This will be enough. General profile based questions asked I was directly asked to say about my work experience and some follow up questions on that, e.g. I was asked a question on SEO.

Avoid mentioning big buzz words like AI, Big Data etc if you do not actually have in depth knowledge of them. Tips for Written Exam I was working in an e-learning start-up at the time of giving the written exam. Before that, I had prepared for the Civil Services exam with Mathematics as my optional subject. So I was fairly conversant with the 12th level mathematics that is tested in the entrance exam. UPSC preparation had also helped expand my vocabulary. Differentiating between correct and seemingly correct English was a subconscious process for me, which helped a lot in the verbal section. So, my preparation before the exam consisted of solving the previous years’ papers and revising some trigonometric identities. Nonetheless, I ended up forgetting those identities in the exam and had to derive them from scratch. Apart from the wisdom to solve the NCERT 11th and 12th maths books, my advice to aspirants is that you should solve all the previous years’ papers diligently on your own even if it takes a lot of time. This way, the solution will be your own and your mind will more easily embrace and remember it. The process will reward you much more than solving any test series. Refer to the internet for detailed solutions only after you have exhausted all your efforts. For those candidates with little background in competitive exams like JEE, GATE, etc., solving a few practice questions of the ISI Tomato exam might be very useful. Try to memorise all the trigonometric identities. Revise all the special cases of permutation and combination and probability problems taught at the 12th level. If you solve past years’ papers, you would realise that most of the difficult questions of the Mathematics part revolve around these topics. The rest are largely basic algebra and geometry questions. Some practice of basic statistics concepts like histograms, pie charts, frequency, central tendency, variance, etc. is also necessary along with the interpretation of graphs. In the verbal section, paragraph-based questions are always very tricky and the most common source of negative marks. So attempt them with caution and practise a lot of such examples. Resources for exam preparation https://www.ctanujit.org/isi-bstat-bmath-exam.html General profile based questions asked No question asked on my general profile Technical questions (Analytics/ML/DS) asked No Analytics/ML/DS question asked Maths/Stats questions asked The last panelist (I presume that he was from ISI) asked which topic of statistics was I most comfortable with. I replied in all honesty that I have zero background in statistics, not even at the UG level. Then I told him that I felt strong enough in Calculus and computational methods as far as mathematics is concerned. So, I was tested on the fundamentals of calculus. I was asked to definite continuity, distinguish it from differentiability and then give examples of functions that are continuous but not-differentiable and vice-versa. I was tested on differentiability of some functions posed by the panelist. In the end, he asked me to compute the integral of the greatest integer function from 1 to 10 without using any paper/pen/calculator. All questions were framed as a natural corollary to one another. There was a hint dropped when I was stuck in the middle of a question. There was however not much time given to think before responding. General Knowledge or related questions One panelist asked me questions entirely on global economics. I was asked about Brexit, its impact on India, WTO, special initiatives to promote manufacturing in India by the Govt., economic soundness of the recent decision to raise import duty on a lot of technical goods. There were a lot of questions one after another around the common area spanned by these topics. Any other kind of questions My interview started with the first panelist straight away asking me why does a ship not sink even though it is so large. How does a yacht capsize? What are the types and directions of friction acting on 2 wheels of a bicycle? and so on. All the questions were from concepts involving class 12th level physics.

Don’t put it anything which you don’t. Tips for Written Exam It’s an iterative process. First go through the syllabus mainly Ncert. And YouTube for other topics. Make a proper notes while reading. It helps a lot while understanding. Derive everything if you can’t go through the proof and then try it yourself. Because many doubts arise when you do the proof. Clarify them. Then test yourself by doing problems and mocks if possible. Identify failure areas. Concentrate on them. For verbal section a great lot of material is available from institutes teaching for CAT. I feel the toughness of Verbal is increasing year by year. So a strong prep in that area differentiates you from other aspirants. If you have a study partner then it will be so much easy. But choose your partner wisely because if your partner is not motivated, it may affect your motivation too. Take plenty of mocks before exam. The mocks in which you underperform teaches you more than where your performance is great. If you feel that your paper is tough then use that opportunity to practice being level headed in face of adverse conditions while answering the paper. Choose your questions logically.

It was a crisp Friday morning and I was seated comfortably in the plush IIMC library. The PGDBA semester was well underway, assignments were raining thick and fast…life was busy…life was good and I was brimming with excitement. I had only just begun working on a competition, which had started 4 days ago on June 14th 2016. It was an inter-university data-science competition called the Data Science Game . With so many constraints such as limited number of submissions in a day and final selection of only one team from a college, it was, by all means the “big deal” and a glance at the list of competing universities showed us some tough nuts. There were the usual suspects i.e. Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford et al., supplemented by a host of premier universities from across the world. Certainly our team of four from first-ever batch of PGDBA, though no novices, were far from being among the best in the world… or were they? And so we – Team Tabs – prepared a starting output, clicked on the ‘Make Submission’ button and waited with a muted yet expectation-laced anxiety that any Kaggler worth his salt would be familiar with and then this image popped up on our screen: Most authors describe moments like these with the cliche ‘There was a moment of silence followed by….’ I discovered that they were quite wrong…as my uncontrollable Hagrid-like laughter filled the breadth of the IIM Calcutta library, defiant of the several bemused yet stern glares that were pointed in my direction! Second in the whole world! Irrespective of its ephemerality, irrespective of the pains required to maintain it or the challenges that we were about to face in the coming three weeks – it was a moment of reckoning for us, a moment to cherish, a moment to savour. Yet, when I look back I can say with certainty that it was at this point I started believing that international glory wasn’t beyond our reach. What followed were some of the most gruelling days of my life. Over the next three weeks, we went on to learn and implement Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithms for image classification. We travelled to multiple universities in a quest for servers to run these algorithms. We learnt, we toiled, we toiled hard and we thrived. When the competition ended, we were the top team from India – Yes! Our hard work and perseverance led to us being the Rank 1 Indian team . We were among the 20 teams from around the world selected to travel to Paris for the final phase of the competition and folks, as you read this article, we’re on the flight journey towards the finals of the competition in Paris, to be held on 9th September. What fills me with even more delight is that not just us, but three teams from India have made it to the final 20 – one each from IIM Calcutta-Team Tabs, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata- The Frequentists (in their ranking order). India has made its presence felt in this 2nd edition of Data Science Game and interestingly enough, all the three institutes are what together constitute PGDBA! It is encouraging to see that three Indian teams have proved themselves worthy of being the global top 20 when 146 teams from 28 countries participated and showed their mettle in this grueling competition. The competition contained an image classification problem. A set of images were given, which had to be classified into four categories. The problem at hand could have been done in various ways. We decided to use deep learning as a lot of interesting work is being done around it and it’s one of the most advanced techniques currently available. We had a basic knowledge about it and developed more understanding as we moved along. The process of compiling and executing codes went on and we worked hard every single day. The machine learning algorithms take time to execute and with limited computing power at our disposal and time constraint of the competition, we ensured that every iota of it was used. As we were fighting neck to neck with all top notch universities across the world, the task was not at all easy and there were a lot of hurdles on the way. The limited computing power slowed us down. Every iteration of the code required a whole day and thus constrained our capacity to experiment with the algorithm. Soon other teams caught up with us on the leaderboard. To wrinkle out the problems we went to IIT-KGP and ISI to gain server access. However, the terminals at both places were preoccupied. As a last resort, we decided to use Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was difficult to set-up because of the complex technicalities and as none of us was acquainted with the process, it made our job all the more difficult. We quickly took charge and read about it from the scratch, spending a precious time of 3 days to figure everything out and get it running. In hindsight, it was worth the effort. Our first run in AWS increased the accuracy by 5 % and it all paid off with the jump on the leaderboard. Now that we look at it, a lot of edge was given to us by our PGDBA curriculum. The basics of machine learning and computing were well laid out throughout the course. It enabled us to deep dive into deep learning and comprehend the technical aspects around it. We also consulted with professors for guidance. With Team Tabs standing at 12 in global rankings, we realize that we have learnt a lot on the way, when we were actually working on the problem statement. We will now be competing with some of the top Kagglers in the finals. The finale would certainly provide us with global exposure as we will get a macroscopic view of what’s happening around the world in the field of data science by interacting with top-notch data analysts spread across the world. Since it’s a 2-day competition, the dynamics of the game is bound to change. We haven’t been able to put in continuous concentrated efforts towards the final round owing to the rigorous academic curriculum this semester and us coping up on classes. We do have a lot to cover but we will keep learning new stuff as we have been doing in the past year. Thus a great opportunity for knowledge transfer and networking lies ahead. With everyone’s hopes in us, we make our journey to Paris, where the final leg of the competition awaits… along with our fateful turnout in the 2nd Data Science Game competition. About the team – “Team Tabs” from IIM Calcutta Pranita Khandelwal – She completed her graduation (B.Tech.) in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and Masters in Economics from BITS Pilani. Initial interest in statistics and then further exploration of online courses made her pursue a career in the data science field. Ritwik Moghe – He is a Mechanical Engineer from IIT Madras.

December 18, 2015 pgdba_admin Campus Life 5 Comments Here comes our atta boy, our cheerful Madhur Modi to speak about our first semester at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. He is a CS grad, tinted with the experience of working in Acrobat Team, Adobe, India for 11 months. Let’s hear what Madhur says! After a not-so long orientation and pre-semester at IIM C, it was time to move to ISI. All of us were already feeling the attachment we had built with each other and formed the spirit of ‘joka tribe’ within ourselves. We started our journey to learn and started packing… but we were not done with the pre-semester yet! 🙂 Not before we can have a last photo-session! Even the journey to ISI was an insightful one! Filled with discussions of memories made within the short month. Happy faces! I remember us all at the peak of our enthusiasm when we visited ISI for the first time after the orientation, this time for around 6 months with knowledge imparted from renowned teachers. Since each of us had opted for the hostel facilities, the registration day was spent in lodging and document formalities. It all began with 5 subjects, 8 teachers and 51 students – daily two hour classes, twice daily where a moment of flickering attention meant you’ll lose the ability to grasp anything for the rest of the class. Yes! We had teachers who could teach us their subject continuously for two hours and every moment… each of them they made us wonder how amazing it is to learn in an enjoyable fashion. We all felt so comfortable moving from our 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional minds to nth dimensions and then move down using multidimensional scaling ☺ ☺ (was I too technical here? Come to ISI and you’ll know what I mean). I bet all our teachers from ISI would be laughing reading the joke here. By the ways, if you’re writing about ISI, it won’t be a just article if you do not mention each teacher separately! Starting from our class teacher and DBMS teacher prof. Pinakpani Pal, it was him who would come to our rescue each time, whether it is to change the mess, requirement of any additional facilities, aid in any procedures or help regarding the subject. He would kindly reach out his hand and solve all our problems in a flick. DBMS was also taught by prof. Amiya and prof. Dilip who would take care of SQL teaching for us. Thanks to him, DBMS was one of the most comfortable subjects in ISI. I still remember the fact that 44 teachers have bhattacharya awards in their name! We all used to marvel at the level of knowledge at ISI, rather, we felt grateful to our teachers for feeding such golden nuggets of information to us daily and Prof. Debasis is the teacher who’s teaching reminded us the reasons they won those awards. I always felt that he teaches one subject but I learned things anyone would consider is worth much more! From histograms, scatter plots, distributions and tests for distributions, he took us to bivariate and the multivariate analysis followed by more tests and feature selection. Moreover, he took extra classes and doubt sessions every week just to ensure that when we learn, we learn well When you start talking about the teachers, each teacher is better than the other! We had Statistical Probabilistic Analysis taught by two teachers, Prof. Bimal and Prof. Kishan. It was the only subject with no assignments, since probability has such a wide scope. This class was all practical, we were given real life examples and applied concepts to solve them. There was yet another similar subject, inference, taught by Prof. Amitava which encompassed all other subjects and drew inference tests from each of them, filled with more real life examples. We had one more course, or rather, set of course ☺ Computing in data science taught by Prof. Saurav Sengupta. I could proudly say to those non-cse students who fear how they would learn programming techniques- this is the course that will help you make your first transition. From practically negligible knowledge, this course taught us not just R and Python, but also made us do an entire team project to deep seat the lessons in our hearts. The best thing? We had fun! I would frequently visit the course website and our project blog and proudly say that we have come far, far from where we were when we entered ISI. P.S. do check out the blog of group 1 authored by our group. 🙂 Didn’t I mention anything else besides studies? How forgetful of me! ISI is a place of happenings! Every other day there were announcements of workshops in various fields of statistics and there were a variety of activities which would now be sweet memories for us with ISI. We flew kites, we had birthday parties, we played games and we had our first formal photoshoot! Looking smart! ISI also had a very special memory… Diwali! What’s that? How did we celebrate it? I could boast that it was better than any student had celebrated while at college! Two of our batchmates, Mr. Avinash (a.k.a. Gandhi) and Mukul cleaned their room and turned it into the Pooja venue (see photos in link) We made diyas, did Pooja, sang bhakti songs, distributed Prasad and made rangoli ! We burnt a few crackers and all our rooms illuminated with the auspiciousness on that day! It was one of the best Diwali celebrations of my life! Diwali! Soon after Durga puja, Diwali and Kali puja, we had our final exams and had to say “Bye Bye ISI” I am thankful that our first semester was conducted at ISI where we learnt such a great deal and progressed so far ahead in our skills. It already feels like we can do most of business analytics even though we have ways to go. How could be go away without saying a delightful adios to our Indian Statistical institute? We requested all the teachers to come for a final photoshoot session. Besides one photo present in CDS website , another photo from the last day would mark a fitting ending to our memories and knowledge lending roller coaster ride at the pillar of statistical, mathematical and machine learning institute!

Could you please tell me what to expect in interview from your experience as i have around 2 months to prepare for it. Madhur Modi January 20, 2016 Reply At this point, do focus on the written test first. You should again be prepared with mathematics for the interview as well. Most of the other questions besides maths are similar to a typical IIM interview. You will need to prepare additional topics as well such as probability and differentiation. Based on your profile, some specific questions might be asked. Also, stay tuned for future posts on the blog where we may post further insights!

The procedure to apply for admission to the PGDBA batch of 2021-2023 will be available here: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/how-apply We strongly recommend you to go through the admission policy here before applying: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/programs/pgdba/admissions/admission-policy-2021-23-batch 2) What are the topics that are expected to covered in the written test? How do I prepare for the test? Is the test of JEE/CAT/XAT level? The syllabus for a previous written test is mentioned here: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/instruction-syllabus We do not have an official set of study materials recommended for the test. However, you can look through the sample paper here: https://www.isical.ac.in/~pgdba/Documents/SampleQuestion2020.pdf , to assess the difficulty level of the test. The actual paper would be fairly close to this set of questions. The set of topics and the sample paper together should help you prepare for the test. Further, they would help you assess the level of the test, in comparison to other tests. 3) What kind of questions can I expect in the interview? The interview mostly revolves around your basic understanding of statistics, probability and a few other relevant mathematical concepts, your work experience and your motivation to join the program. There may also be questions on other aspects of your profile, some latest events and so on. Here are a few interview experiences of the students from 2020-2022 batch that should give you a fair idea of what to expect: https://aspirants.pgdba.ml/2021/04/03/pgdba-interview-experiences-2020-22/ 4) Is my profile good enough to make it to the program? As long as you fulfill the basic eligibility criteria, your final selection comes down to your profile (including your academics and your work experience), your score in the written test and in the interview, and additionally, the pool of candidates applying with you, given the limited number of seats. 5) What are the expected cut-offs for various categories (General, SC/ST, NC-OBC) for the written test? The institutes do not disclose this information. However, you may know your score in the written test by dropping a mail to the admissions office, post the test. 6) Which of the three institutes awards the degree? The final degree is awarded jointly by all three institutes: IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata.

Most of the other questions besides maths are similar to a typical IIM interview. You will need to prepare additional topics as well such as probability and differentiation. Based on your profile, some specific questions might be asked. Also, stay tuned for future posts on the blog where we may post further insights!

Feb 1, 2021 — by pgdba_admin in Uncategorized PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

Tech. in Engineering Physics with minor in Photonics Work Experience No If Yes, then total Work Experience in No. of Months Name of the Organization Questions asked in PGDBA interview along with your answers. There were three interviewers on the panel .I was asked to tell me something about myself and what I want to do next (probably an icebreaker). While I was doing that, they read my CV and asked me about my 3-month internship in Taiwan and the work that I did there. Following that up, they asked me about one other project in depth that I did in Physics. (They didn’t ask me about other projects that were mentioned in the CV which were in relevant fields, like Data structures and another one in Analytics). Then came the part around which majority of the interview revolved. The professor in the middle said ,so you are from IIT Delhi. I should assume you have amazing skills in Mathematics.I said you can say that. The professor sitting on the left asked me about double derivatives, maxima-minima, limits, continuity of 4-5 different functions, each time giving a more complex function and tried to test whether I knew what I was saying and asked me to draw a few functions. But the questions were quite basic and he seemed happy with the answers. *Over to the professor in the middle*. He asked me if my degree had a probability course. I told him that it didn’t but I did a course in Probability and Stochastic processes for extra credits in third year. He asked me to write the probability density function, the cumulative density function of exponential distribution and then draw both of them. When I did that, he asked me what a memoryless process is. I told him that the future state of the process depends on the current state of the process and not the past states . He said that is not the description of a memoryless process. I tried to make him understand in a few different ways but he said no. Then the professor wrote a differential equation that I had never seen in my life. He asked me what it was. I could only answer that it was a linear homogeneous differential equation because beyond that I had no idea. He said it is a linear homogeneous differential equation but what is the name of the equation. I looked at it and tried to remember but in vain. Then he said, it must have been taught to you in the first year. I said it wasn’t taught. He said, it is simply impossible. You need to go back home and look at your notes. I couldn’t argue as it would look bad on my part. *Already sinking in my chair* *Over to the professor on the right* He asked me that you have played basketball on a lot of levels as mentioned in your CV, tell me name of one player. I was relieved that he didn’t ask the size of the court or the ball which I had mugged up the previous night.I said Kobe Bryant. He asked who is the greatest player of all time. I said Michael Jordan. He asked me to name one player playing in NBA who is from India. I answered Satnam Singh. Then he asked me to name one player from team India to which I answered Amritpal Singh and the interview was then over.The written test had more weightage as inspite of not performing very well in interviews, I was selected. Any suggestion for aspirants regarding preparation for written test and interview. Ace the written test and for the interview focus on everything that’s in your CV very well Name Guntur Prabhudev College Name IIT Kharagpur Year of Graduation 2017 Degree and Specialization Dual Degree in Ocean engineering and naval architecture Work Experience No If Yes, then total Work Experience in No. of Months Name of the Organization Questions asked in PGDBA interview along with your answers.

My interview started off with the standard tell me about yourself and my well rehearsed answer.With the unimpressive resume that I had, I couldn’t talk about my work experience or academic excellence. Instead, I spoke at length about my personality traits and aptitude that make me a natural fit for analytics and ended with my motivations for joining PGDBA. Around this time, having gone through my file, one of the interviewers saw that my work experience had not remotely anything to do with analytics or data science and asked my how they tied together. I admitted that they didn’t, that over the years, I had made some decisions and if I could go back and do it all over again, I would not make the same choices and that, I was looking for a second chance. Then they asked me how good I was in Mathematics and if I remembered anything from the course ‘Probability and Random Processes’ I had studied in UG. I said that I was above average and optimistically, good and no, I did not remember, but I had been revising some of the concepts. Then they asked me to solve the puzzle on the white board (It was a 4X4 grid where you had to calculate the number of paths from the lower left corner to the top upper corner). I had already come across that before and told them, and solved it on their insistence upon which I was given further cases on the same grid that I was able to solve. Then, a brief discussion about why I shouldn’t pursue PhD instead of PGDBA ensued (I answered I would, after the course), concluding the interview. The interview time was about 8-10 minutes.

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

What is your current role in ONGC? 2. What types of value-added products are produced in ONGC Hazira- told, then we had a further discussion related to one of the units- LPG unit. 3. What type of quality parameters, different data generated related to that unit. I did a small self-project related to LPG unit during my time in ONGC which was very helpful in the interview as most of the time was spent on that. Interview Questions: Mathematics & Statistics based I was asked only two questions related to Statistics by an ISI panelist after some discussion about my self-project. 1. You have some numerical data. If you add an outlier to that data, which one of the measures of central tendencies will affect the most? (Mean) The panelist asked first if I knew the measures of central tendency. (Mean, Median, Mode) 2. Basic application of Central Limit Theorem. From a population, you are taking some sampling data (80-90 samples I donâ€™t remember exactly), so how will you calculate the mean of the population? I mentioned CLT and then he asked what is the CLT? I told him the basic definition and he was satisfied and my interview was over. Interview Questions: Machine Learning/ Coding based None GK & current affairs Interview questions (If any, please specify) None Miscellaneous Interview Questions Questions asked by IIMC panelist at the start- 1. Tell me about yourself. 2. You are currently working at ONGC. You have a good job and further scope in your field then why do you want to leave ONGC? I told him I did some basic courses in data analytics online which got me very interested in the field so I want to learn more and change my profile. 3. So if you have decided you are going to leave such a high-paying job, did you do any financial analysis on this? I told them frankly I don’t know how to do financial analysis yet. I added further that I am not focusing on what I am leaving. I am looking forward to learning analytics and the opportunities I will have after that. The IIM C panelist said-fair enough and did not ask any follow-up questions on that and moved on to questions related to my hobby. Can you tell me the difference between Pool and Snooker? Who is the current snooker world champion? What do you do besides playing snooker? Any other hobby. I answered the first two well. Just fumbled a bit and tried to provide extra details on the second question which should’ve been avoided. In the end, I said I don’t get enough time for snooker so I don’t have another hobby. The panelist smiled and asked the IIT-KGP panelist to take over.

This followed up with – ISI Prof – define Business Analysis? How to ensure data is reliable for prediction and how to fill missing data? He asked me to convince him to invest in Tata Steel Stock and then gave me a simple P&C math problem and tested me on how confident I’m on the answer. At last asked me who is the present minister of steel and education for which I said I don’t know after the recent reshuffle. Interview Questions: Mathematics & Statistics based As I said, ISI Prof asked a question on simple math P&C and tested my confidence by reiterating the answer in different ways. IIT KGP Prof – Gave me a problem on conditional probability (I mentioned that I had training on analytics before covid in Tata Steel by a ISI Prof – an MoU program of Tata Steel with ISI K), attempted but made a mistake then hinted this is based on some condition. Then I identified that this was a problem on Bayes Theorem, explained the approach but couldn’t solve it. He appreciated that I heard about Bayes theorem and then asked me questions on axioms of probability for which initially I fumbled but he connected the missing points while I’m answering and appreciated again that I know about the axioms and concepts. Interview Questions: Machine Learning/ Coding based Nope GK & current affairs Interview questions (If any, please specify) IIM C Prof – Asked me my favorite news topic, for which I said I read all types of news.

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

There was a panel of 3 interviewers – one from each institute. Himanshu Goyal – B.Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering, 2011 , IIT Delhi; 5 years of experience in BFSI, Global Analytics Duration: 20-25 mins Questions that were asked: Tell us about your achievements Why do you want to join PGDBA Write equation for linear and logistic regression (was asked due to my background at work) A puzzle which used the property of mean A question on odds ratio and probability Experience and Review: Why PGDBA? or Why should we take you? needs to be very well prepared. You should be able to show that you are serious about this course and are making an informed choice. Everyone has a reason of their own and you will have to find one for yourself as well which you can pitch. In case you have work experience, you should be able to explain your roles and responsibilities in a comprehensive and confident way. My interview didn’t go well and I remember not being hopeful after it but my written test had gone very good which must have had a good impact. ————————————————————————– Waqar Sarguroh – B. Tech. in Chemical Engineering, IIT Roorkee, 2014; 25 months of work experience in Oil and Gas (Refinery) and EdTech Startup Duration: 20 mins Asked to explain the product of the EdTech startup that I worked for. Discussed customer segmentation based on usage of app. Asked to explain classification and clustering and explain the difference. The interviewers were very helpful as I had only an elementary idea about the concept. They walked me through the thought process by asking guiding questions. An algebraic expression of positive integers to be maximised given a constraint. (Using AM > GM) What is BRICS? What is the economic situation of BRICS countries? Did you write CAT? Why not an MBA? SUGGESTIONS-The main focus was on the ability to think through a problem. Building on ideas and communicating your thought process appropriately. ————————————————————————– Anushree Parsai – B.E. in Electronics and Communication, BITS Hyderabad, 2014; 2 years of work experience at ARM Duration: 30-40 mins As my interview questions were mostly centered around current affairs, I feel the interviewers were looking for students who were good at academics and also kept track of current events of national and international importance. They asked me following questions – Which states will be having elections this year? Do you know about GST bill? How will it help? State 3 major achievements of Narendra Modi so far? Factors responsible for Syria conflict and views on it? Based On Work experience: How are defects identified in electronic chips? Define defect and differentiate it from from fault. There was one basic question on mathematics as well on finding continuity of a function. ————————————————————————– Naveen Mittal – B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering, KNIT Sultanpur, 2016 Duration: 20-25 mins Most of the questions related to Computer Science such as complexities of algorithms, sorting, searching, N-P hard problems, etc. Also, questions from management subjects in B.Tech curriculum such as IM, IS, IP were asked. Problems were given which required basic applications of statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation etc. and drawing inferences using such measures. Calculus questions were asked, theorems such as Cauchy-Reimann, etc. were asked. Some HR questions like Why do you want to join PGDBA?? SUGGESTIONS-Be confident. Even if you do not know some of the answers don’t think that you can bluff with them. Say politely that you cannot recollect or remember the answer. I was able to answer Computer Science and Engineering related questions which happen to be my discipline during B.Tech. and maintain a positive attitude and confidence throughout the interview. ————————————————————————– Khushiram Sharma – B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering, IIT(BHU) Varanasi, 2013; 36 months of experience in BPCL as Retail Engineer and Asst. Mgr., Operations. Duration: 25 mins They asked me to briefly explain my profile of work. As I have been to many places during this time and the last one being Gorakhpur (UP), they picked a question from there. They asked me to give five cultural differences between UP & Rajasthan(I am from Ajmer) and also explain how they are different. They stopped me when I had explained four of them convincingly. They asked one question on maths which is as follows : We have identified four places in Rajasthan to be made headquarters of education for state. Out of these we have to finally select only three based on the distances need to be travelled by people in future. All other conditions will remain same for all places. Given this before jumping for any solution, I discussed about further assumptions like population density, shape can be assumed as per my drawing, people will travel to their nearest headquarter (as per straight line distance). Finally they said, all other conditions will remain same for all places. After trying for 2 minutes, they made little bit easier i.e. I have three locations and have to select two of them. Now I drew perpendicular bisectors of this triangle and then explained the solution. They asked me whether I know coding, and I said” primarily no except that I studied C language 6 years ago.” Then they asked to write a code for printing my name(string) in reverse order, which I did. I think your approach to the given problem will be a crucial factor in cracking the interview. ————————————————————————– Himanshu Jain – B.E. in Electronics and Communications Engineering, NSIT Delhi, 2013; 11 months of experience in IT Advisory (Analytics) Consultancy, KPMG; 24 months of experience in Samsung Data Systems (IT industry) Duration: 15-20 mins.

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 12, 2017 No Comments on What is PGDBA? “Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.” – Geoffrey Moore, Organizational Theorist & Author Analytics: Need of the Hour The amount of data in our world is exploding. As per a McKinsey report, big data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function the same way as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition. The increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media and the Internet of Things will fuel exponential growth in data in the foreseeable future. The rapid pace with which data is being generated across various domains and fields would require people with deep analytical skills to provide insights, enabling companies to gain a competitive edge and offer a better consumer experience. The insights from the data are used for various purposes such as segmentation of customers for better targeting, prediction of churn rate, product recommendation, analysis of customer opinion from media posts, preventive maintenance, management of portfolio risk etc. Untapped potential in India In India, the analytics market is expected to double between 2013 and 2018, reaching a figure of US$ 2.3 billion by 2018, according to a report published by NASSCOM and Blueocean Market Intelligence. This will result in a shortage of about 200,000 data scientists in India over the next few years, according to sources in the Analytics Special Interest Group setup by NASSCOM. Hence, creation of trained industry-ready business analytics professionals is the need of the day. Globally, the demand of data scientists is projected to exceed supply by more than 50% by 2018. To address the paucity of trained workforce in analytics domain, the onus is on the educational institutes to address the needs of the industry. The three institutes IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata are aware of the demand for the well rounded analytics professionals. In order to understand the needs of the industry, a day long conclave was held in January 2015 in IIM Calcutta. Representatives of the leading companies such as KPMG, EXL, Deloitte, LatentView, TCS, Reliance Communication, Deutsche Bank, E&Y, SBI, IBM, Google, Microsoft, HSBC and Cognizant took part in the conclave and based on their inputs, ideas of a specialized course emerged, a course which would produce leaders of the future, skilled in the essential areas of business, statistics and computer science. Through this collaboration between industry and academia, PGDBA was born. Introduction to PGDBA PGDBA is a two year full time residential diploma programme aimed at creating business analytics professionals employable by leading Indian and foreign firms. This programme is designed for those who have an analytical mindset, are interested in tackling challenging business problems, and possess an inclination towards Mathematics. Some of the salient features of the programme include courses taught by reputed faculty members at the campuses of three globally renowned institutes, hands-on business analytics training at a related company, continuous interaction with industry leaders throughout the duration of the programme and the availability of placement opportunities at all the three institutes. The three institutes complement each other to give students the most comprehensive learning of business analytics. The course finds the optimal balance between the theoretical concepts of data science and their applications to business problems. Students get to regularly interact with industry experts through invited talks and guest lectures, where experts talk about the latest trends and challenges in the industry. The course leverages the best of the three institutes in their respective fields of expertise, i.e., Statistics, Technology and Business. In the first semester at ISI, students form a strong base of Mathematical and Statistical concepts. This is followed by a semester at IIT Kharagpur, where students work on data science projects and get to test their statistical concepts built at ISI. This semester is meant to build students’ technical expertise. To complement the first two semesters, students spend their third semester at IIM Calcutta where they are exposed to business problems through case studies and industry interactions. To cap it all, the students get to implement their knowledge in the industry through a six months long internship as their fourth semester. Placements The students from the first two batches of PGDBA experienced highly successful placement processes. Companies from various industries such as BFSI, Consulting, Healthcare, Research, Retail, Gaming, Technology etc. participated and handpicked candidates suitable for both data-driven and business driven analyst roles. The placement processes witnessed the involvement of Fortune 500 companies such as American Express, Walmart Labs, UnitedHealth Group, JPMC, Amazon, Walmart Labs. Some of the job profiles offered were Senior Data Scientist, Analytics Manager, Statistical Analyst, Lead Business Analyst, Solution Analyst, Experienced Associate, Assistant Project Manager. With continuously increasing demand of business analytics professionals, the future of PGDBA looks promising. The unique opportunity of learning from three top-notch institutes of the country is unparalleled by any other Data Analytics course. Recently, PGDBA was ranked 1 by the Analytics India Magazine among the data science courses offered in the country.

Madhur Modi It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds. Here’s a showcase of their profiles: Alok Mani Singh The civil engineer from BHEL, and the “stud” with 4-year worth of experience from a Maharatna PSU and IIT Guwahati attached in his name was the first person who secured his foreign intern in the prestigious Dunia Finance in Dubai. The “Perfect Statistician” as well as the “Management expert” who can solve any problem that comes his way “within a night or two”. He also likes to play guitar and has entertained us for past one and a half years with his pleasant voice. Now he will be working closely with the head of strategic analytics function at Dunia during his 6-month internship in Dubai. Siddhant Sanjeev “Coder” as everyone in the batch knows him to be, was the only other person to impress the company Dunia and accompany Alok to Dubai. Everyone in the batch knows him as a fresher with computer science background from NSIT and a national level coder. He also got himself an interview offer from Google owing to his coding skills as well as won case competitions from PwC and Deloitte. He also developed an e-commerce website using intricate concepts of natural language processing, recommendation systems and information retrieval. Ankitkumar Sonthalia Better known as “Sonthu”, this guy has 3 years of work experience from Cognizant and now he is going to work for Rocket Internet in Myanmar. He has worked on marketing strategy, predictions and recommendation systems. He is a travel enthusiast and has organized many unforgettable trips for our batch. He has also conducted cricket fantasy league and freshers’ party. Rachit Tripathi A mechanical engineer from IIT Kanpur by mind and a quant trader by heart, Rachit bagged an internship in France at QuantCube Technology, a niche fintech company. He’s also part of the team selected for data science game, an international inter-university competition held in Paris. In his pursuit of becoming a quant trader, he obtained CFA level 1 certification and solved various cases from those on Walmart to those on Yahoo data. He is also known as the “data scientist” of the batch and has recently been selected as one of the finalists in Goldman Sachs Quantify competition. Avinash Kumar He is a mechanical engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has worked in L&T for 3 years. He was offered an internship at Rocket Internet which he did not take as he aspired to work in India. He has written an international research paper and also has been part of the Data Science Game with Rachit during this course. He also won NASA systems engineering award while being a B.Tech. student. Besides, he is also a skilled TT player as well as a chess enthusiast. Bharathi Ramaraj Bharathi got the internship offer from Rocket Internet but she decided to stay in India. The only girl to get a foreign internship offer, she is a fresher with B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering. She has worked on uplift modeling, high-frequency data and news analytics and has taken part in various Kaggle competitions. She is also an international chess player and has traveled to as many as 16 countries representing India. She envisions being a financial analyst and to use advanced analytics techniques in a financial credit company to build her career. Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world. Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics. Categories Articles Experiences ISI Chapter Chances of Consequence Post author By pgdba_admin Post date September 20, 2016 No Comments on Chances of Consequence Grown-ups love figures. When you tell them that you’ve made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, “What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. -The Little Prince Our first exams in this first semester at ISI have finally arrived. One of the subjects of the course, and of the more interesting ones I might add, is ‘Probability and Stochastic Processes’. This was also the subject of our first exam. I have been pouring over notes and hundreds of pages of text in preparation of this exam. The intricacies in some of the ideas reminded me of these lines taken from ‘The Little Prince’ and quoted by David Freedman in his book on Statistics. Are such matters as figures and charts always dry and boring? In our first class, the professor of the same subject also remarked, “Maybe our insistence on numbers is the limitation of man”. ‘The Little Prince’ is a famous classic written by Saint Antoine du Exupery. Although it was first written as a children’s book, it has been enjoyed over the years by adults alike as a heart-warming story on friendship, growing-up and the curious fascinations of man. One of the oft used coinages in the book is the phrase ‘matters of consequence’. The Little Prince finds, at one point, a man aimlessly counting stars to the extent that he reaches ‘five hundred and one million’. This man then ironically refers to his counting as a matter of consequence. In these days leading up to our exams, I began to wonder whether factuality could be made interesting in the context of some intricacies I came across in problems of Probability Theory. Are there questions that I can ask that are not as dry as the character’s occupation of counting in The Little Prince? Consider the following questions. How many random people would I need to collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that at least two of them share their birthdays? The answer to this is a surprisingly low number. Let’s look at a different question. How many people would I need to catch hold of and ask birthdays of to have half a chance of finding someone who shares my birthday? It is also interesting to note that this number is different from the first one. Louis CK, the famous stand-up comedian, made an interesting remark in one of his live shows. He said that there were enough people attending his show for there to be a fair chance that a few of them would die in the coming year. Ouch! Let’s pose that as a question on chance. Assume a population with a certain death rate. What is the number of people I would have to randomly collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that someone would die tomorrow? Enough with birthdays and death days. Consider coin tosses. Say, I keep tossing a coin and keep getting heads for a hundred tosses. I only know that it is equally likely that my coin is anything between a perfectly rigged coin to a perfectly fair coin. What is the chance that I win if I bet on the next toss to be heads? Let’s stretch this slightly further. Let us assume that when the universe was born, the probability that the sun would rise over planet earth each day was made to depend on a coin toss. We only know that this coin was likely to be anything between a perfectly fair to a perfectly unfair coin (God is playing a cruel game). What is the probability that the sun would rise tomorrow, given that it has been rising each day over all these years since the birth of the universe? Let’s give some rest to our poor coin and move on to other questions. The Monty Hall Problem is a famous example on how sometimes the idea of chance can stump intuition. Here’s a different example in a similar vein. Suppose there are three suspects in jail who have been cleared of any wrongdoing and are all going to be released soon. It is announced that two of the three would be released the next day but these three don’t know exactly which two of them will be released. One of them decides to go ask the guard which one of the other two prisoners is going to be released. But then he thinks the following to himself, “After I have asked, I have only a one in two chance that I’m the second guy to be released. But before I ask, there is a two in three chance that I will be one of the guys to be released. So should I rather not ask?” Like one of our professors quips so often, ‘Remember that there’s a chance model somewhere in the background.’ Somebody somewhere is flipping a coin. Maybe someday a story will be written on a travelling mathematician who visits magical planets to ask questions on chances of consequence. It’s a long shot that it would be anything as beautiful as the masterpiece that is the ‘The Little Prince’. But I wager it wouldn’t be as bad as dry pointless counting. Categories Articles Experiences Technical Joka Library to Paris – A Data Science Crusade Post author By pgdba_admin Post date September 7, 2016 No Comments on Joka Library to Paris – A Data Science Crusade A peek into Team Tabs, one of the three teams representing India at DSG. It was a crisp Friday morning and I was seated comfortably in the plush IIMC library. The PGDBA semester was well underway, assignments were raining thick and fast…life was busy…life was good and I was brimming with excitement. I had only just begun working on a competition, which had started 4 days ago on June 14th 2016. It was an inter-university data-science competition called the Data Science Game . With so many constraints such as limited number of submissions in a day and final selection of only one team from a college, it was, by all means the “big deal” and a glance at the list of competing universities showed us some tough nuts. There were the usual suspects i.e. Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford et al., supplemented by a host of premier universities from across the world. Certainly our team of four from first-ever batch of PGDBA, though no novices, were far from being among the best in the world… or were they? And so we – Team Tabs – prepared a starting output, clicked on the ‘Make Submission’ button and waited with a muted yet expectation-laced anxiety that any Kaggler worth his salt would be familiar with and then this image popped up on our screen: Most authors describe moments like these with the cliche ‘There was a moment of silence followed by….’ I discovered that they were quite wrong…as my uncontrollable Hagrid-like laughter filled the breadth of the IIM Calcutta library, defiant of the several bemused yet stern glares that were pointed in my direction! Second in the whole world! Irrespective of its ephemerality, irrespective of the pains required to maintain it or the challenges that we were about to face in the coming three weeks – it was a moment of reckoning for us, a moment to cherish, a moment to savour. Yet, when I look back I can say with certainty that it was at this point I started believing that international glory wasn’t beyond our reach. What followed were some of the most gruelling days of my life. Over the next three weeks, we went on to learn and implement Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithms for image classification. We travelled to multiple universities in a quest for servers to run these algorithms. We learnt, we toiled, we toiled hard and we thrived. When the competition ended, we were the top team from India – Yes! Our hard work and perseverance led to us being the Rank 1 Indian team . We were among the 20 teams from around the world selected to travel to Paris for the final phase of the competition and folks, as you read this article, we’re on the flight journey towards the finals of the competition in Paris, to be held on 9th September. What fills me with even more delight is that not just us, but three teams from India have made it to the final 20 – one each from IIM Calcutta-Team Tabs, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata- The Frequentists (in their ranking order). India has made its presence felt in this 2nd edition of Data Science Game and interestingly enough, all the three institutes are what together constitute PGDBA! It is encouraging to see that three Indian teams have proved themselves worthy of being the global top 20 when 146 teams from 28 countries participated and showed their mettle in this grueling competition. The competition contained an image classification problem. A set of images were given, which had to be classified into four categories. The problem at hand could have been done in various ways. We decided to use deep learning as a lot of interesting work is being done around it and it’s one of the most advanced techniques currently available. We had a basic knowledge about it and developed more understanding as we moved along. The process of compiling and executing codes went on and we worked hard every single day. The machine learning algorithms take time to execute and with limited computing power at our disposal and time constraint of the competition, we ensured that every iota of it was used. As we were fighting neck to neck with all top notch universities across the world, the task was not at all easy and there were a lot of hurdles on the way. The limited computing power slowed us down. Every iteration of the code required a whole day and thus constrained our capacity to experiment with the algorithm. Soon other teams caught up with us on the leaderboard. To wrinkle out the problems we went to IIT-KGP and ISI to gain server access. However, the terminals at both places were preoccupied. As a last resort, we decided to use Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was difficult to set-up because of the complex technicalities and as none of us was acquainted with the process, it made our job all the more difficult. We quickly took charge and read about it from the scratch, spending a precious time of 3 days to figure everything out and get it running. In hindsight, it was worth the effort. Our first run in AWS increased the accuracy by 5 % and it all paid off with the jump on the leaderboard. Now that we look at it, a lot of edge was given to us by our PGDBA curriculum. The basics of machine learning and computing were well laid out throughout the course. It enabled us to deep dive into deep learning and comprehend the technical aspects around it. We also consulted with professors for guidance. With Team Tabs standing at 12 in global rankings, we realize that we have learnt a lot on the way, when we were actually working on the problem statement. We will now be competing with some of the top Kagglers in the finals. The finale would certainly provide us with global exposure as we will get a macroscopic view of what’s happening around the world in the field of data science by interacting with top-notch data analysts spread across the world. Since it’s a 2-day competition, the dynamics of the game is bound to change. We haven’t been able to put in continuous concentrated efforts towards the final round owing to the rigorous academic curriculum this semester and us coping up on classes. We do have a lot to cover but we will keep learning new stuff as we have been doing in the past year. Thus a great opportunity for knowledge transfer and networking lies ahead. With everyone’s hopes in us, we make our journey to Paris, where the final leg of the competition awaits… along with our fateful turnout in the 2nd Data Science Game competition. About the team – “Team Tabs” from IIM Calcutta Pranita Khandelwal – She completed her graduation (B.Tech.) in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and Masters in Economics from BITS Pilani.

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date August 27, 2016 No Comments on The Best Laid Schemes, of Spiders and Men! What do entropy, linear programming and Riemann surfaces have in common? Puzzled? Now imagine this connection explained by an eccentric speaker in the attire of a French stage magician, with the charm and virtuosity of a storyteller. Cedric Villani, French mathematician, Fields Medal awardee in the year 2010 and famously called by the NewYorker magazine as the ‘Lady Gaga of Mathematics’ delivered a public lecture titled ‘Of Triangles, Gases, Prices and Men’ at ISI on 26 th August 2016. The second PGDBA batch, currently in its first semester here at ISI, had the opportunity to be present at this intriguing and informative session. Cedric Villani The abstraction and intrigue of Cedric could be assumed from the fact that an introduction to him included a reference to the number of his pets. This abstraction could also be inferred from the title of his talk, which was a play on the title of John Steinbeck’s famous classic ‘Of Mice and Men.’ The first slide of his presentation was taken from Tennyson’s Lady of Shalott. In Cedric’s own interpretation, the Lady of Shalott, accursed to see the world only through a mirror, was actually an allegory to the mathematician forever accursed to look at reality through his equations! Cedric then said that there are many more unsolved mysteries in Mathematics today than there were a hundred years ago. There are ever so many new problems that keep arising. Then there are those age-old ones that lie in famous mathematicians’ lists of unsolved problems. One such famous unproved hypothesis is the Riemann hypothesis. This led Cedric down the path to explaining Riemann’s works and then to the first part of the evening’s presentation – ‘triangles’. He introduced to the audience Riemann surfaces and how Escher employed curved surfaces in his art. As examples of negative curvatures, he showed images of art installations in museums and models of coral reef. Einstein, with the help of his mathematician colleagues, used Riemann’s ideas to develop his General Theory of Relativity. Cedric went on to add that, the GPS technology so ubiquitous in the world today has its roots in Riemann’s works in topology. In a humorous turn of speech, Cedric noted that Riemann was as oblivious to his work being of practical use in 21 st century devices, as modern day GPS users were to Riemann’s surfaces. An ironic symmetry indeed! At this turn of his presentation, Cedric spoke about how it is equally important for scientists to pursue inspiration and not just utility. He marked out Riemann as someone who was particularly interested in approaching problems in his own unique way. Cedric quoted Poincare who had once said, “Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.” The second part of his talk on ‘gases’ started with a description of his visit to Vienna and a search for Boltzmann’s grave. He said that he stopped to ask a family for a map not expecting them to know Boltzmann, let alone his grave. To his surprise, he was not only directed to the location of the grave but the person also exclaimed Boltzmann’s equation of entropy, “S=klogW”! In connection with entropy, he then talked about the Gaussian curve, its ubiquitous nature and its uncanny appearance in many natural systems. He called the study of Probability and Statistics as ‘the extraordinary adventure of mastering of chance.’ As a matter of coincidence, he discussed a famous problem in his presentation called ‘Buffon’s needle’, which was also discussed in class earlier on the same day with the PGDBA students by their lecturer. Experiments such as coin tosses, Cedric said, are best done in the most careless ways! Then he explained how gases are modeled as billiard balls in collision and when there are many such sufficiently small billiard balls, their velocities are accurately modeled as the Gaussian distribution. As a note, Cedric remarked on the power of this distribution by quoting Sir Francis Galton who once called it the ‘supreme law of unreason.’ The next part of his presentation was ‘prices’. Cedric introduced Leonid Kantorovic, the father of linear programming. He explained how math is used to model the optimal allocation of resources. He then strung together ideas from the optimized distribution of resources to the distribution of gas molecules with the least loss of energy. The analogy of prices in linear programming is energy in distribution of gas molecules. This is where Cedric began piecing everything together with the last part of his talk called ‘men’. Cedric described how he had happened to meet his collaborators John Lott and Felix Otto. These men put together the ‘triangles’, ‘gases’ and ‘prices’ and helped Cedric complete his research on how fast gases reach the equilibrium stage described in Boltzmann’s equation. Cedric was awarded the Fields medal in connection with this research. What would have been an intimidating subject matter coming from volumes over volumes of text, was aptly introduced in a two-hour lecture by Cedric Villani, a master at his trade, a storyteller par excellence, a dinosaur catcher in his childhood dreams and a true ambassador of modern mathematics. In a surprising irony of sorts, apart from the many hidden mysteries in the details of his works, the most apparent mystery is the brooches of spiders that he wears on the lapels of his coat! Categories Articles Experiences General The Journey of Identities Post author By pgdba_admin Post date August 14, 2016 No Comments on The Journey of Identities To all those who just joined in. And to all those who couldn’t. I’ve jumped ships. I’ve made the leap. I am now a part of what they call Tata Hall- the luxurious guesthouse at IIM C, when I used to be a part of what they called Himadri (my IIT Delhi hostel). I am convinced that recording my first impressions of this maddening, surreal odyssey that I have set out on will not only prove to be fruitful in retrospect, but in fact help me in retaining my sanity in the present. For those of you who have been wondering what I’m going to blabber about, I would like to give you some context before you abandon me. I am now a student at the PGDBA program. I am comfortably living in my posh suite of the guesthouse of IIM C, with my amazing roommate, situated in Joka, which is nearly thirty kilometers away from the city of Kolkata. There are one hundred and three other students in this program who live with me, so I am sometimes tempted to forget that we are literally in the middle of nowhere. We are being fed an illusion – but an irresistible one that I don’t have the heart to snap out of. In some ways, the fact that the city is beyond my reach is liberating. The five years I spent living in the heart of Delhi, and then another two years in the legendary city of Mumbai, I craved for an escape, for a way out. I think this program has finally answered my call for help. Here, I am constantly told that I am special, that I am the chosen one. The twenty-four years of my life that have led to this moment have made me so cynical that I doubt their belief in me. But at the same time, I greatly value it. After a very long time, I am around people who are willing to invest in my future simply because the three accomplished panel members saw a spark in me, during the twenty-five minutes I spent interviewing for the program. I feel humbled and terrified. The two years ahead are going to demand every inch of me, it is going to consume me, and it is going to change me. But for so long I have felt nothing, that this rush, this constant buzz in my head, this restlessness feels good. I am sleep-deprived, surviving on n number of cups of terribly made tea and coffee and hopping from one assignment to the other with some extended breaks thankfully, and yet, I am alive. How often is it that you are so committed to the moment that every other structure inside and outside your mind breaks form, and this particular moment is all that you can see, all that you can register? This program is one such moment in my life. The program, which aims at producing a team of unparalleled business analysts and data scientists, supposedly the sexiest job in the market these days, has been ideated by the three premiere institutes of India – Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This very credibility generates the “Pygmalion effect” and drives me to excel in the area of analytics. The coming two years make me realize, that I’m far away from the comfort zone and stability that life had offered just before I decided to enroll into PGDBA. But I am also glad that it happened, for I can now appreciate the morning for what it truly represents – a fresh start. I like the concept of this new beginning, for it brings with it the exciting journey of exploring new dimensions and reconstruct your identity. I am tempted to fantasize about the future, but I am trying to contain my excitement to the moment. So many paths seem to call out to me that my brain will explode if I start to think too much. What do I want, you ask? Organized chaos. If you think that is romantically abstract, then you have understood me just a little more than you did before you began to read this note. I will end with a few lines that so perfectly describe my state of mind right now, that I might just marry Robert Frost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.

The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Reply Venkatesh says: January 16, 2016 at 9:17 am Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:36 am For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well. Reply Hardik Agarwal says: March 27, 2016 at 12:44 pm URGENT : If I don’t have an important document that has to be shown during the interview process in original (as said in the call letter), can I show its copy and give an undertaking of that? Will it work or will they cancel my candidature? Thanks in advance. Reply Madhur Modi says: April 20, 2016 at 10:04 am The interviews are already over. I think you would have already received the instructions from the panel about this Reply subhodeep says: April 19, 2016 at 10:28 am hi, i converted my PGDBA call. i am looking forward to join this course and very optimistic about it. just need to convince myself that avg salary will be equivalent to PGDM of IIMC. how is the industry perceiving this course. are companies like BCG and MCG lined up for PGDBA? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:00 pm Hi.. did you join the course?? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:01 pm What was last year’s cut-off to get the admissions?

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

A family has two children given that one is a girl. Find the probability that the other child is a boy. (Give them correct answer I think as 1/3). PANELIST 2: IIM CALCUTTA Q3. What should I take the two prime number so that sum is a perfect square. And that perfect square is always divisible by which number. (He was interested in approach ) I said let two prime numbers be 6k+1 and other be 6p-1 or 6p+1 so the sum of two prime numbers be 6(k+p) or 6k +6p +2 , i give the answer 19 and 17 which sum 36 and said that number will always be divisible by 2 ( both professor said he is not satisfied with why u let prime number as 6k +1 and 6p+1), i do the method correct but they are not satisfied with my approach. Q4. How do u find the roots of polynomial equation numerically ? He gave me hint that u have studied in engineering but I am unable to recall. PANELIST 3: ISI professor -> asked vague STATISTICS. Q5.

Keep a note of questions you found challenging the first time you solved and keep revisiting them periodically to get comfortable with the Quant section. 2. DILR and VARC are comparatively simpler than CAT, so don’t need to solve very difficult problems while practicing for these sections. 3. For interview, try to frame the introduction in a way that drives the professors to your strong points. Be strong with Probability Statistics, Linear Algebra and first year Engineering Math basics. There will certainly be some questions from one of these topics.

No General Interview Questions based on your work experience and profile (Write in points) P1: Asked me about my background. My role as a software developer there. what I have done after my first job. (I’m currently working as an inspector central tax.) He asked to explain the difference between IGST, CGST etc. Who’s benefiting from GST? (I said win-win, tried to explain but was cut short) What’s the rate of inflation. (Retail inflation is upwards of 7%. I think 7.4%) Has CGST effected inflation. (It’s the other way round.. inflation has effected GST) Mathematics and Statistics related interview questions (if any, please specify in points, else write None) P2: what do you want to be asked about in maths? (I said linear algebra, calculus..) 1. Suppose you have A 5X2 and B 2X5. What can you say about the rank of AB. Why? Tried to explain.. he said I’m just applying a formula.. so i said we can take a variable matrix A, B and multiply them… Then convert it into Row Reduced form, I’m sure we’ll get rank almost 2). P3 was specifically called on to ask “Engineering Questions”. P3: Is relaminarisation possible? ( I said its been a long time, I don’t remember. He said these are basics, you should not forget) What’s choking in a flow? How does it impact the diameter of the nozzle? What if I keep increasing the diameter? (I said as the diameter increases, pressure decreases and if the flow is too fast, there will be shocks) What’s an instantaneous flow? (No time lag between starting and the point in consideration) How do you measure an instantaneous flow? ( I was trying to explain some method, he said it’s differential calculus) What is Euler’s integral theorem? (complex analysis.. explained from what I remembered. Forgot to use the word residue.) What’s the difference between Hessian and Jacobian? (Explained that Hessian is used to get an idea about the maxima and minima while Jacobian is used while transforming coordinate axis) Where do you use them? If I say one of them contains first order partial derivatives of vector valued function what will it be? (I said Jacobian. He asked if I’m sure, then I said both contains first order partial derivatives. Then he said one of them has partial derivatives of scalar valued function and one has partial derivatives of vector valued function) In simulations, we use Euler’s method 1, Kutta 2, Kutta 4.. what’s the difference? (I said these are used for numerical integration.. he said *that’s not it*.. they have something to do with the time factor.) After that, he said to other profs, we have asked him enough questions.. they agreed and they said I may leave.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Maunish Shah December 22, 2015 Reply Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? pgdbaunofficial December 16, 2015 Reply There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. sarthak aggarwal December 29, 2015 Reply sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Mbs January 1, 2016 Reply What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 ankit gupta January 12, 2016 Reply can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material?

Tips for Written Exam Attempt previous year PGDBA question papers to get a feel of the exam format and difficulty level. There’s no one-size-fits-all kind of strategy for the PGDBA exam; you will have to tailor your preparation according to your strengths, weak areas, and the time you can manage to take out for your prep. Cutoff is usually in 100-110 (out of 150) range, but aim to score 130-140 in order to have realistic chances of conversion, as high weightage is given to written score,. Resources for exam preparation DILR – Any CAT prep material is sufficient. VARC- Any CAT prep material is sufficient. QA – “Test of Mathematics at the 10+2 Level” book by ISI comes highly recommended. You may also refer class 11-12th Maths books, for revisiting concepts and theory.

A: Was unable to solve, so told the panelist that i was unable to arrive at an answer, and explained my approach to him. Q4. Let’s say you want to estimate the number of Red colored Maruti Altos running in your city. How will you approach this problem? A: * The population of my city is approx. 1.8 Cr. * Let’s say there are 5 members per family. Therefore total families = 1.8Cr / 5 = 36L. * Let’s say that there is 1 car per 2 families. Therefore total cars = 36L / 2 = 18L. * Maruti Suzuki has a market share of about 50% in Delhi. Therefore total Maruti cars in Delhi = 18L * 50% = 9L * Alto has been one of the best selling cars of Maruti Suzuki. Let’s say 10% of all maruti sales have been that of Alto. Therefore total Alto cars in Delhi = 9L * 10% = 90,000 * Since Red is not a common color, let’s say only 2% of the Alto cars sold in delhi were of Red color. Therefore total red colored Maruti Alto in my city ~ 1800 cars. General Knowledge or related questions 1. What does “Aatma-Nirbhar Bharat” mean? 2.

The first question is as expected by me, introducing myself, for which, I have mentioned my academic and work background including the ML related projects, which I have done during my UG, having been prepared to answer any questions related to my ML projects but my first question came from mathematics. The panelist has given me a hypothetical scenario where I have to set up a steel plant abroad. What are the things I have to look for before selecting the place to set up the steel plant. I have mentioned the prominence of abundant water supply for steel plant, Labour laws of that state, availability of cheap labor, transportation system inside the country and export restrictions of the country. The panelist then asked a question on labor laws to which I honestly admitted that I am not much aware of it. What technical questions (relevant to Analytics/ML/DS) did the panel ask? As, I belong to civil engineering background and worked in design office, I have not been asked any ML/DL questions What Mathematics/Statistics questions did the panel ask? As I said earlier, my first question is about probability. The question is an algorithm that returns value one if the point satisfies the circle condition of unit radius for x and y. I was asked to compute the probability of getting one, for which I have computed the probability of areas ( area of circle to overall domain area of x and y). I was asked what is Poisson distribution and asked me to show the general form of Poisson distribution. A follow-up question to the same, where they asked me if there is any similarity between Poisson and Binomial distribution, for which, I have answered as the no of trials increases for a binomial distribution it would become a Poisson distribution. Another follow up question to the same is which is the limiting case? Is it the binomial the limiting case of Poisson or the other way round what is a Singular matrix?

Written Exam I was inherently comfortable with quants. So, I concentrated more on verbal part. It depends on what youâ€™re comfortable with. Also, irrespective of that, I think one should spend more time on preparing verbal part because the RCs are getting tougher year after year and they ask for any vocabulary. For para jumbles, the more you practice, the better. While preparing for verbal, make sure you cover the current affairs by reading the Hindu and editorials because thatâ€™ll help you for both the exam (vocabulary wise) and the interview because they ask anything under the sun during interviews. Pay equal attention towards LRDI and quants because thatâ€™s heavy on scoring. Even if you are not sure about any answer in the verbal part, you should be 100% accurate in LRDI and quants. Thatâ€™s how you can maximize your score above 130. Useful resources for exam preparation (if any) For Verbal and LRDI, concentrate on CAT or an equivalent material.

Tell us about yourself. 2. Why do you want to get into Analytics? 3. Why do you prefer PGDBA over many other Analytics courses? 4. It is know that PGDBA students get decent packages during placements. Is that why you prefer PGDBA? 5. According to you, what defines the success of a course like PGDBA? What technical questions (relevant to Analytics/ML/DS) did the panel ask? None. What Mathematics/Statistics questions did the panel ask? 1. Can you prove the empirical formula of measures of central tendencies? Ans. The formula is Mode = 3*Median – 2*Mean. It is only an observational result that Karl Pearson concluded after performing a large number of tests on different data. Hence, it has no mathematical proof. 2. What is the difference between local minima and global minima? I could not give a clear answer to that as they were not satisfied with the basic understanding I had about it. 3. What are the difference and the similarity between Standard Normal Distribution and Normal Distribution? Ans. Normal Distribution can have any mean and variance but Standard Normal Distribution has a mean of 0 and variance 1. The Mean, Median and Mode are all same for both distributions. (The entire panel disagreed with my answer but I did not change my answer because I knew it was right) General Knowledge or related questions (if any) 1.

The interviewer asked me to give my opinion on whether the batting average in cricket is a good measure of the batsman’s ‘average’ run-scoring performance, as it does not take into account the number of innings when the batsman remained not out. – Explained that the term given for the measure can be a bit misleading if considered as an average per inning, as per my understanding, it actually is a measure of how many runs a batsman scores before getting dismissed (between two successive dismissals) 1b. The interviewer asked me to then suggest a better metric for measuring the per inning average score by the batsman. – Suggested the use of quartile scores. 1c. Can we give make a rewarding adjustment to the batsman’s score if he remains not out, comparing it with his current average performance? – Each inning is affected by a multitude of factors, rewarding on the basis of just the historical performance may not be the most optimal choice. If a reward score is given, should also penalize the batsman for getting out before his average score. 2. Give an example of numbers that have the same mean and standard deviation. – (0, 0, 0, …) will have the standard deviation 0 and mean 0. The interviewer then asked for a non-trivial solution and asked whether (2, 0) will satisfy the given condition. 3. Describe hypothesis testing, what is significance level.

The application form for the written test had sections to mention about the extracurricular activities, achievements and hobbies. Tips for Written Exam VARC: The level was somewhat similar to CAT and other MBA entrance exams. One can practice from previous year cat materials or something related to that and it will be enough. There would be some para jumbles and other verbal type questions too. Plus there are no TITA type questions. DILR: It’s the easiest section in PGDBA. Almost everyone scores full here. You can check previous year PGDBA papers and you will get to know about it. If you still feel that you need practice then you can practice the very basic questions from cat sample papers. QUANT: Here one has to put a little more effort. It includes topics such as calculus, limits, continuity, conic section etc. One can say it contains almost all topics of 11th and 12th. For this one has to revise NCERT books of both 11th and 12th. Also, if one has time then he/she can practice questions from RD Sharma Objective Mathematics . This will be enough. General profile based questions asked I was directly asked to say about my work experience and some follow up questions on that, e.g. I was asked a question on SEO. And some general questions like “if you are not selected then what would you do”. No questions on UG subjects. Technical questions (Analytics/ML/DS) asked No technical questions were asked on Analytics/ML/DS Maths/Stats questions asked I was given a trigonometric expression and was told to find its minimum value. General Knowledge or related questions I was asked about Covid-19 vaccines and how analytics has made present vaccines different from earlier vaccines.

Avoid mentioning big buzz words like AI, Big Data etc if you do not actually have in depth knowledge of them. Tips for Written Exam I was working in an e-learning start-up at the time of giving the written exam. Before that, I had prepared for the Civil Services exam with Mathematics as my optional subject. So I was fairly conversant with the 12th level mathematics that is tested in the entrance exam. UPSC preparation had also helped expand my vocabulary. Differentiating between correct and seemingly correct English was a subconscious process for me, which helped a lot in the verbal section. So, my preparation before the exam consisted of solving the previous years’ papers and revising some trigonometric identities. Nonetheless, I ended up forgetting those identities in the exam and had to derive them from scratch. Apart from the wisdom to solve the NCERT 11th and 12th maths books, my advice to aspirants is that you should solve all the previous years’ papers diligently on your own even if it takes a lot of time. This way, the solution will be your own and your mind will more easily embrace and remember it. The process will reward you much more than solving any test series. Refer to the internet for detailed solutions only after you have exhausted all your efforts. For those candidates with little background in competitive exams like JEE, GATE, etc., solving a few practice questions of the ISI Tomato exam might be very useful. Try to memorise all the trigonometric identities. Revise all the special cases of permutation and combination and probability problems taught at the 12th level. If you solve past years’ papers, you would realise that most of the difficult questions of the Mathematics part revolve around these topics. The rest are largely basic algebra and geometry questions. Some practice of basic statistics concepts like histograms, pie charts, frequency, central tendency, variance, etc. is also necessary along with the interpretation of graphs. In the verbal section, paragraph-based questions are always very tricky and the most common source of negative marks. So attempt them with caution and practise a lot of such examples. Resources for exam preparation https://www.ctanujit.org/isi-bstat-bmath-exam.html General profile based questions asked No question asked on my general profile Technical questions (Analytics/ML/DS) asked No Analytics/ML/DS question asked Maths/Stats questions asked The last panelist (I presume that he was from ISI) asked which topic of statistics was I most comfortable with. I replied in all honesty that I have zero background in statistics, not even at the UG level. Then I told him that I felt strong enough in Calculus and computational methods as far as mathematics is concerned. So, I was tested on the fundamentals of calculus. I was asked to definite continuity, distinguish it from differentiability and then give examples of functions that are continuous but not-differentiable and vice-versa. I was tested on differentiability of some functions posed by the panelist. In the end, he asked me to compute the integral of the greatest integer function from 1 to 10 without using any paper/pen/calculator. All questions were framed as a natural corollary to one another. There was a hint dropped when I was stuck in the middle of a question. There was however not much time given to think before responding. General Knowledge or related questions One panelist asked me questions entirely on global economics. I was asked about Brexit, its impact on India, WTO, special initiatives to promote manufacturing in India by the Govt., economic soundness of the recent decision to raise import duty on a lot of technical goods. There were a lot of questions one after another around the common area spanned by these topics. Any other kind of questions My interview started with the first panelist straight away asking me why does a ship not sink even though it is so large. How does a yacht capsize? What are the types and directions of friction acting on 2 wheels of a bicycle? and so on. All the questions were from concepts involving class 12th level physics. I was found wanting in conceptual clarity in these topics. Interview duration (in minutes) 22 mins Did you feel that your interview was a stress interview? No Overall Interview Experience 4 Tips for Personal Interview Practise speaking impromptu in front of the mirror. Improve your articulation. Instantaneous conversion of our thoughts into the most meaningful words is a skill that comes only with experience. Do not mention anything in your form which you cannot defend.

Don’t put it anything which you don’t. Tips for Written Exam It’s an iterative process. First go through the syllabus mainly Ncert. And YouTube for other topics. Make a proper notes while reading. It helps a lot while understanding. Derive everything if you can’t go through the proof and then try it yourself. Because many doubts arise when you do the proof. Clarify them. Then test yourself by doing problems and mocks if possible. Identify failure areas. Concentrate on them. For verbal section a great lot of material is available from institutes teaching for CAT. I feel the toughness of Verbal is increasing year by year. So a strong prep in that area differentiates you from other aspirants. If you have a study partner then it will be so much easy. But choose your partner wisely because if your partner is not motivated, it may affect your motivation too. Take plenty of mocks before exam. The mocks in which you underperform teaches you more than where your performance is great. If you feel that your paper is tough then use that opportunity to practice being level headed in face of adverse conditions while answering the paper. Choose your questions logically. The universe will be on your side. Resources for exam preparation Combinatorics on the YouTube channel math quest.

I politely told the interviewer that I was not getting it. The panalist tried encouraging me to solve it I tried for a while but couldn’t so I told him that I didn’t want waste the time dwelling on that single problem. He said fine my work is done and passed on to the next panalist. I was expecting another problem from him but his response sent a couple of chills down my spine. The next panelist asked me what did I know about statistics as I was from mechanical engineering background. I told him that we use statistical quality control in mechanical engineering and I told him that I have gone through a book called statistics for engineers by Anthony hater. He tested on that by giving different scenarios and asking what would be the probability distribution it would follow. I remember that the panelist had asked questions about distributions that were mentioned as optional/additional study in the book. I was so happy that I didn’t skip those while studying. He then asked about Memoryless property of distributions and then passed on to the third panalist.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand.

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material?

So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day.

When you tell them that you’ve made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, “What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. -The Little Prince Our first exams in this first semester at ISI have finally arrived. One of the subjects of the course, and of the more interesting ones I might add, is ‘Probability and Stochastic Processes’. This was also the subject of our first exam. I have been pouring over notes and hundreds of pages of text in preparation of this exam. The intricacies in some of the ideas reminded me of these lines taken from ‘The Little Prince’ and quoted by David Freedman in his book on Statistics. Are such matters as figures and charts always dry and boring? In our first class, the professor of the same subject also remarked, “Maybe our insistence on numbers is the limitation of man”. ‘The Little Prince’ is a famous classic written by Saint Antoine du Exupery. Although it was first written as a children’s book, it has been enjoyed over the years by adults alike as a heart-warming story on friendship, growing-up and the curious fascinations of man. One of the oft used coinages in the book is the phrase ‘matters of consequence’. The Little Prince finds, at one point, a man aimlessly counting stars to the extent that he reaches ‘five hundred and one million’. This man then ironically refers to his counting as a matter of consequence. In these days leading up to our exams, I began to wonder whether factuality could be made interesting in the context of some intricacies I came across in problems of Probability Theory. Are there questions that I can ask that are not as dry as the character’s occupation of counting in The Little Prince? Consider the following questions. How many random people would I need to collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that at least two of them share their birthdays? The answer to this is a surprisingly low number. Let’s look at a different question. How many people would I need to catch hold of and ask birthdays of to have half a chance of finding someone who shares my birthday? It is also interesting to note that this number is different from the first one. Louis CK, the famous stand-up comedian, made an interesting remark in one of his live shows. He said that there were enough people attending his show for there to be a fair chance that a few of them would die in the coming year. Ouch! Let’s pose that as a question on chance. Assume a population with a certain death rate. What is the number of people I would have to randomly collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that someone would die tomorrow? Enough with birthdays and death days. Consider coin tosses. Say, I keep tossing a coin and keep getting heads for a hundred tosses. I only know that it is equally likely that my coin is anything between a perfectly rigged coin to a perfectly fair coin. What is the chance that I win if I bet on the next toss to be heads? Let’s stretch this slightly further. Let us assume that when the universe was born, the probability that the sun would rise over planet earth each day was made to depend on a coin toss. We only know that this coin was likely to be anything between a perfectly fair to a perfectly unfair coin (God is playing a cruel game). What is the probability that the sun would rise tomorrow, given that it has been rising each day over all these years since the birth of the universe? Let’s give some rest to our poor coin and move on to other questions. The Monty Hall Problem is a famous example on how sometimes the idea of chance can stump intuition. Here’s a different example in a similar vein. Suppose there are three suspects in jail who have been cleared of any wrongdoing and are all going to be released soon. It is announced that two of the three would be released the next day but these three don’t know exactly which two of them will be released. One of them decides to go ask the guard which one of the other two prisoners is going to be released. But then he thinks the following to himself, “After I have asked, I have only a one in two chance that I’m the second guy to be released. But before I ask, there is a two in three chance that I will be one of the guys to be released. So should I rather not ask?” Like one of our professors quips so often, ‘Remember that there’s a chance model somewhere in the background.’ Somebody somewhere is flipping a coin. Maybe someday a story will be written on a travelling mathematician who visits magical planets to ask questions on chances of consequence. It’s a long shot that it would be anything as beautiful as the masterpiece that is the ‘The Little Prince’. But I wager it wouldn’t be as bad as dry pointless counting. ← Joka Library to Paris – A Data Science Crusade → Foreign Internships: Ambassadors of PGDBA Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Maunish Shah December 22, 2015 Reply Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? pgdbaunofficial December 16, 2015 Reply There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. sarthak aggarwal December 29, 2015 Reply sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Mbs January 1, 2016 Reply What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 ankit gupta January 12, 2016 Reply can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Venkatesh January 16, 2016 Reply Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well.

The aim is to provide a general idea about the profile of the students and their respective interview experiences to help aspirants prepare better for the big day. PS – The interview panel consisted of three members. Bharathi Ramaraj – B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering; International Chess Player “I introduced myself as a chess player. And the first thing that followed was why I wanted to pursue Analytics, being a chess player. I said, I wanted to make an impact, also decision making plays a big role in analytics thus being a chess player gives me the apt mindset in the field. I gave real-life examples where I used chess playing skills and also highlighted my enthusiasm towards chess by describing how I view situations as a chessboard and how I involve members as pieces playing the game. The panelists gave me new situations to test my viewpoint by letting me turn the interview into a game of chess where the panelists and I were pieces on the board. I took up the problem and described various strategies that I had at my disposal. I spoke at length about the best strategy that I would deploy to win the game. They also asked about the factors which led me to pursue analytics like my placement in an analytics company and why I wanted to complete postgraduate studies. To this I replied, doing it now would help me save time and gain an early advantage which will be very valuable in the long run. My interview was relatively short compared to other candidates.” ****** Shashank Kumar -B.Tech in EEE , 2.5+ years of experience in VLSI design “I was the first person to be interviewed at my center. The conversation started with current affairs and the morning news. The analytics projects during my engineering were heavily focused upon. Technical questions included topics like probability, regression, various types of regression and analysis of the quality of fit based on residual plots. The interview spanned around 15 minutes. In hindsight, I think it was a pretty short interview” ****** Sajal Jain – Class representative (PGDBA 2015-2017),B.Tech in Civil Engineering with 4 years of experience in software industry “My interview wasn’t strictly a technical one. The few questions included questions on differentiability and continuity and other basic mathematical concepts. My interview majorly focused on how, in my view, my background of civil engineer with more than 4 years of experience in software industry would indulge in a career in analytics and add a different value and perspectives to the batch. The questions were not at all tough so I would advise the candidates to be firm in their basics” ****** Ayan Sengupta , a fresher who has done BSc and MSc in mathematics and computing “Having a background different from most of the other candidates, my interview was naturally quite unique in its own way. I expected a tough line of questioning from the panelists but my interview consisted of aptitude questions such as how I would find a method for the CEO of the company I work in to cross a river given that he doesn’t know swimming. There were also other puzzles such as – Why manholes are round and simple mathematical questions covering number theory . The interview was around 20-25 minutes long.” ****** Shoorvir Gupta , a fresher in mechanical engineering and an IES aspirant “My interview started with the description of my college and grades. I mentioned my college life and how I became inclined towards gaming, had all A’s in technical subjects, very high CAT score and a 10 pointer in internship. The rest of the interview was focused on IES and related questions to various fields in IES, questions on strength of material and on boilers and its parts (mechanical subjects). Technical questions were mostly around probability and statistics and its applications. Towards the end of the interview they also asked about my background and hometown related questions.” ****** Ritwik Prashant , a fresher with B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and amongst the most meticulous students within the batch “I started with my introduction and how I was in touch with analytics (Coursera courses). I also described my interests in fantasy football where one has to apply optimizations and statistics in decision making. Technical questions were based around matrices where they made a deep dive until they touched unfamiliar topics. Being a fresher from IIT Madras, they also questioned me about my college placement and my orientation towards this course rather than taking up a job. Thus my entire interview was based on the initial steer I had provided with my introduction.” ****** Pranita Khandelwal , a fresher with dual degree (EEE and Economics) “The interview started off with the recurring question about my degrees- how I ended up studying both Economics and EEE. Later, I was tested on my knowledge of econometrics, and the panel asked some conceptual questions on linear regression and decision making using hypothesis testing. This was followed by questions related to my projects and internships .” ****** Avinash Kumar, a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience “I steered my interview with my introduction towards my college project at USA and my job profile description. The questions covered as to how I could apply data analytics to these projects and how other projects such as six sigma projects are related to analytics. Among technical questions, most of them were based on geometry and also tested my creativity and open mindedness. I had applied through GATE and was oriented towards aerodynamics so I mentioned why I wanted to pursue an analytics career and implement analytics in aerodynamics sector. I highlighted my orientation with awards (NASA system engineering award-1st prize) and description of college project. Even though most of the other candidates had 15 minute interviews that day, mine was a lengthy 35 minute one.” ****** Mukul Kumar , a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience and with same background as Avinash Kumar “Just like Avinash, I steered my interview with my introduction towards why I wanted to pursue analytics. I mentioned how I had researched and gained opinion about analytics from my peers and seniors and felt that the course aligns with my interests in mathematics and thus I can do justice to the course. Technical questions included mathematical ones (hyperbolic functions and their graphs, differentiation,1st differentiation principle and limit) but none on mechanical engineering. I had also applied through GATE and was asked the interview calls I had received. There were also questions based on puzzles and a few questions from written test which we had given during the pre-interview process.” ****** Sujan Biswas – BSc and MSc in chemistry, 2.75 years of experience in Banking and financial services “My panelists began with questions about my background and current job profile and drifted over to mathematical questions covering even and odd functions and matrices. Other questions included optimization based questions and decision making problems such as the methods and parameters one would use to determine whether to provide a loan to an individual or not. There were also situational problems such as – Given that Ph.D students have a higher default rate but high profits and MBA students have lower default rate and lower profits, how would you define your business. Overall my interview was nice and the panelists were not grilling.” ****** Mohammed Tariq , B.Tech in computer science in engineering, 10 months of experience in Business intelligence “Prior to joining the course, I described my experience of a 6-month certification course in analytics. I was also asked about statistics. They asked in-depth questions on calculus going to the levels at which I could not solve. Since I have already done a PG course which used R programming language, Tableau tool and projects, I answered what subjects I learned during the course, experience of the course and my development of interest in PGDBA after completing the course. The interview was mainly focused on my interests in analytics.” Analytics Experience IIM Calcutta Interview PGDBA Student Life students Post navigation Next Article Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge Previous Article PGDBA Interview Experiences – Part 2 Related Articles Interview Experiences PGDBA 2025-27 Interview Experiences Greetings, Future PGDBA Achievers!

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century. Tags Analytics , Data Sciences , IIM Calcutta , IIT KGP , ISI , PGDBA , Student Life Categories About Us What is PGDBA? Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

Sitting there all cozy in the 6-9 show of Avenger’s- End Game, the last few moments were surely the emotional roller-coaster. The intense ending of the movie in contrast with the intimation on my selection for the prestigious PGDBA programme made it the quintessential end game. In the amalgamation of a multitude of emotions, there were the elements of concern that made me wonder how the two-year journey would pan out. Having been selected for such a reputed course, I was cognizant of the fact that I would get to meet numerous talents with unparalleled finesse. As today marks the successful one-year completion of my PGDBA journey, I would love to be the raconteur to share an account of my experiences till date. IIMC Bridge Lake IIMC Classroom Mesmerized by the pulchritude of the IIM Calcutta campus, I was all set to traverse the invigorating voyage. In the orientation week, I got acquainted with most of my batch mates and realized the level of diverse expertise each one possessed. It was followed by the ‘ordinary’ classes at IIM, where, every minute seemed like an incessant race against time, all for the quest of managerial acumen. Pre-semester was like a trailer of a fervent flick. In the backdrop of quizzes, case-studies, assignments, and presentations, a funky fresher’s party came like rejuvenation. Organized by our seniors, the soirée provided a platform for showcasing extra-curricular abilities. The parade of variant talents made me acknowledge the multiple prowess, our PGDBA batches owned. With each day that passed by, the hues of pre-sem grew fonder, until the time when it was concluded with a grilling semester exam. CD Deshmukh Bhavan @ISI Birthdays @ISI Diwali @ISI ISI Farewell And in no time, we all were in ISI Kolkata , mecca of Mathematics. The contrast could easily be spotted. Every nook and corner emanated erudite vibes. However, the aura of the institute was pleasant and welcoming. The race here was with knowledge. The devotion and pursuit for learning appeared pristine, which was also shown by the top-notch professors in their readiness to impart wisdom while being compassionate and understanding, enlightening the students in all aspects. With a chunk of peers playing badminton, others peering at them from the top and a few busy with the bulk of assignments, it was at times difficult to decide the activity one really wished to engage in. Apart from juggling between classes and projects, the quest for analytics competence prompted most of us to participate in several Data Science and B-schools competitions, wherein the laudable performances brought laurels to PGDBA. On the social front, be it the magnificence of the Kolkata Durga Puja celebrations, the vigor in Diwali revelry by the entire batch, or just the joy in exploring the city markets, all these would be cherished for life. As the winter winds drew near, the snug yet strenuous ISI semester ended, with a heart-warming farewell and a challenging end-term exam. Main Building @IITKGP Nehru Museum @IITKGP Holi VGSOM Building And soon, with the commencement of the year 2020, we all arrived at the enormous premises of IIT Kharagpur , where the chase was after an efficient time-management. From cycling to the classes to evening strolls to Tech-Market, switching academic buildings between periods to settling into the morning 8 routine while enduring winters, it was quite grueling in essence. In the thick of a bustling semester, the splendor of the Spring Fest, marked by the vibrant live performances and a frolic atmosphere, rolled in like fresh air. This was soon diluted by an enervating mid-semester exam, that seemed boundless. This semester, brimming with tonnes of academic activities, got shadowed, by the swelling plight of the COVID-19 pandemic and as aftermath, it was switched to online mode. As we arrive closer to the completion of this semester, it can be unequivocally opined that this was the most exhausting, yet had its own tunes, to which our rhythms got harmonized. The course is undoubtedly pretty demanding, which sometimes makes you question the worth of all the efforts. But, in the midst of an ongoing semester, when you find the beaming faces and satisfied souls of seniors after securing tremendous placements, where the giants across the country were hell-bent on hiring in a bunch, you realize the influence the power of the triumvirate, the structure of the course and your efforts can create.

Madhur Modi It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds. Here’s a showcase of their profiles: Alok Mani Singh The civil engineer from BHEL, and the “stud” with 4-year worth of experience from a Maharatna PSU and IIT Guwahati attached in his name was the first person who secured his foreign intern in the prestigious Dunia Finance in Dubai. The “Perfect Statistician” as well as the “Management expert” who can solve any problem that comes his way “within a night or two”. He also likes to play guitar and has entertained us for past one and a half years with his pleasant voice. Now he will be working closely with the head of strategic analytics function at Dunia during his 6-month internship in Dubai. Siddhant Sanjeev “Coder” as everyone in the batch knows him to be, was the only other person to impress the company Dunia and accompany Alok to Dubai. Everyone in the batch knows him as a fresher with computer science background from NSIT and a national level coder. He also got himself an interview offer from Google owing to his coding skills as well as won case competitions from PwC and Deloitte. He also developed an e-commerce website using intricate concepts of natural language processing, recommendation systems and information retrieval. Ankitkumar Sonthalia Better known as “Sonthu”, this guy has 3 years of work experience from Cognizant and now he is going to work for Rocket Internet in Myanmar. He has worked on marketing strategy, predictions and recommendation systems. He is a travel enthusiast and has organized many unforgettable trips for our batch. He has also conducted cricket fantasy league and freshers’ party. Rachit Tripathi A mechanical engineer from IIT Kanpur by mind and a quant trader by heart, Rachit bagged an internship in France at QuantCube Technology, a niche fintech company. He’s also part of the team selected for data science game, an international inter-university competition held in Paris. In his pursuit of becoming a quant trader, he obtained CFA level 1 certification and solved various cases from those on Walmart to those on Yahoo data. He is also known as the “data scientist” of the batch and has recently been selected as one of the finalists in Goldman Sachs Quantify competition. Avinash Kumar He is a mechanical engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has worked in L&T for 3 years. He was offered an internship at Rocket Internet which he did not take as he aspired to work in India. He has written an international research paper and also has been part of the Data Science Game with Rachit during this course. He also won NASA systems engineering award while being a B.Tech. student. Besides, he is also a skilled TT player as well as a chess enthusiast. Bharathi Ramaraj Bharathi got the internship offer from Rocket Internet but she decided to stay in India. The only girl to get a foreign internship offer, she is a fresher with B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering. She has worked on uplift modeling, high-frequency data and news analytics and has taken part in various Kaggle competitions. She is also an international chess player and has traveled to as many as 16 countries representing India. She envisions being a financial analyst and to use advanced analytics techniques in a financial credit company to build her career. Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world. Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics. ← Chances of Consequence → What is PGDBA?

In winter, Calcutta and the ISI campus seem to be embedded in a timescale of their own. The cool climate, with the leisure of end of semester break and the occasional chai in little earthen cups are an apt climax to a wonderful first leg of the PGDBA course here at ISI. We had the opportunity to attend a lecture delivered by Dr. Sourav Sengupta held in the same Machine Learning workshop this week. Souravda, as he insisted we must call him when we first met in July, taught us a course titled ‘Computing for Data Science’ in this semester’s coursework. The topic of his workshop lecture on Tuesday was Linear Algebra and I couldn’t help but smile as I reminisced the most enjoyable classroom experience that I had in the past semester. When I decided on writing this piece I was lost for ideas on how to do justice, in the measure of just a few words, to a semester’s worth of constantly brilliant teaching. Just plain superlatives for Dr. Sourav Sengupta would not suffice to explain the privilege I feel in being his student. There are many moments in class that I felt amazed as he walked us through a topic, drawing out concept after concept, most times exercising the last resource of our grey cells. With his characteristic smiles and pauses, he conducted the class like an orchestra maestro. He was always thoroughly prepared with the flow of his lectures that were packed with information and insight. Maybe trying to recap a few highlights would help reflect the memorable journey we’ve had in class. Of our first few trysts in Souravda’s class was the one with Linear Algebra. He introduced matrix multiplication as an operation on vector spaces. Starting with linear combinations of vectors and the space they spanned, he guided us to a vector space representation of the linear least squares estimate of a system of equations. This might seem arcane to some, but the charm was in the ease with which he explained the ideas of multidimensional spaces and vectors in the context of something as simple as least squares approximation. Another of such crescendos was when he tied eigen values, Markov chains and the power method in a lecture on how Google first developed a base for ranking webpages called PageRank. It was almost a revelation when I first realised, “So this is a Markov chain!” In another lecture, Souravda explained the notion of volume as it applies to higher dimensions. He compared a unit ball with a unit square. A unit square in two dimensions is completely contained inside a unit ball. The farthest that a square can get from the origin is root of 1/2 (1/4 +1/4 = 2/4) whereas a unit circle is at a fixed distance of 1 . In three dimensions, a cuboid is still inside a sphere and the farthest it gets to is square root of 3/4 . Now, as we move up to four dimensions, the farthest point inside the ‘box’ is at square root of 4/4 which is 1 . So in four dimensions, the box just touches the ball but is still contained entirely inside it. “What happens, when we move higher up”, asked Souravda in class. It so happens that the unit box creeps out of the ball in the fifth dimension and further up, in still higher dimensions, most of the volume of the box is not contained inside the ball. This was just one aspect of the notion of distances that he discussed. In another class, we discussed the distance between two sentences or text corpuses to see how similar or different they were. And as measures of similarity of two sets, Souravda then introduced us to hash functions and MinHashing. “How would you develop a system to choose one person from three people, uniformly at random, by using just the outcomes of coin tosses?” This is one of Prof. Bimal Roy’s favourite questions (previous Director and professor of MathStat department) that Souravda introduced in class with us. He then extended the discussion to choosing uniformly at random from n people and then on to storing streaming data in an efficient way. PCA, SVD, Linear Regression and Regularisation, Clustering, Classification and Regression Trees, Bias-Variance Trade-off in learning algorithms, SVM, Recommender Systems, Expectation Maximisation are the other broad topics that he discussed at a constant level of commitment and brilliance. And that is just his teaching. There’s another side to the person that is Souravda. His utmost sincerity and dedication, at times when it seemed unimaginable why a person should go so far out of his way to help, was an immeasurable gift during the course. At times when he explained algorithms for certain applications, he would use the common refrain, “But can you do any better?” in trying to guide us to more efficient solutions. A lesson that Souravda’s students could take from his classes, of which his own dedication was sufficient evidence, was to keep asking themselves, “Can you do any better?” Thank you and farewell, Dr. Sourav Sengupta.

A family has two children given that one is a girl. Find the probability that the other child is a boy. (Give them correct answer I think as 1/3). PANELIST 2: IIM CALCUTTA Q3. What should I take the two prime number so that sum is a perfect square. And that perfect square is always divisible by which number. (He was interested in approach ) I said let two prime numbers be 6k+1 and other be 6p-1 or 6p+1 so the sum of two prime numbers be 6(k+p) or 6k +6p +2 , i give the answer 19 and 17 which sum 36 and said that number will always be divisible by 2 ( both professor said he is not satisfied with why u let prime number as 6k +1 and 6p+1), i do the method correct but they are not satisfied with my approach. Q4. How do u find the roots of polynomial equation numerically ? He gave me hint that u have studied in engineering but I am unable to recall. PANELIST 3: ISI professor -> asked vague STATISTICS. Q5. We have used histogram to check and analysing the variability of data. What is one drawback we see in histogram. Q6.(This question is very absurd i don’t understand) Y= f(x) and Y = F (X) where x is random variable let f(x)follow exponential distribution …what can u conclude about F(X) , he said u know the difference in X and x right.

Keep a note of questions you found challenging the first time you solved and keep revisiting them periodically to get comfortable with the Quant section. 2. DILR and VARC are comparatively simpler than CAT, so don’t need to solve very difficult problems while practicing for these sections. 3. For interview, try to frame the introduction in a way that drives the professors to your strong points. Be strong with Probability Statistics, Linear Algebra and first year Engineering Math basics. There will certainly be some questions from one of these topics.

No General Interview Questions based on your work experience and profile (Write in points) P1: Asked me about my background. My role as a software developer there. what I have done after my first job. (I’m currently working as an inspector central tax.) He asked to explain the difference between IGST, CGST etc. Who’s benefiting from GST? (I said win-win, tried to explain but was cut short) What’s the rate of inflation. (Retail inflation is upwards of 7%. I think 7.4%) Has CGST effected inflation. (It’s the other way round.. inflation has effected GST) Mathematics and Statistics related interview questions (if any, please specify in points, else write None) P2: what do you want to be asked about in maths? (I said linear algebra, calculus..) 1. Suppose you have A 5X2 and B 2X5. What can you say about the rank of AB. Why? Tried to explain.. he said I’m just applying a formula.. so i said we can take a variable matrix A, B and multiply them… Then convert it into Row Reduced form, I’m sure we’ll get rank almost 2). P3 was specifically called on to ask “Engineering Questions”. P3: Is relaminarisation possible? ( I said its been a long time, I don’t remember. He said these are basics, you should not forget) What’s choking in a flow? How does it impact the diameter of the nozzle? What if I keep increasing the diameter? (I said as the diameter increases, pressure decreases and if the flow is too fast, there will be shocks) What’s an instantaneous flow? (No time lag between starting and the point in consideration) How do you measure an instantaneous flow? ( I was trying to explain some method, he said it’s differential calculus) What is Euler’s integral theorem? (complex analysis.. explained from what I remembered. Forgot to use the word residue.) What’s the difference between Hessian and Jacobian? (Explained that Hessian is used to get an idea about the maxima and minima while Jacobian is used while transforming coordinate axis) Where do you use them? If I say one of them contains first order partial derivatives of vector valued function what will it be? (I said Jacobian. He asked if I’m sure, then I said both contains first order partial derivatives. Then he said one of them has partial derivatives of scalar valued function and one has partial derivatives of vector valued function) In simulations, we use Euler’s method 1, Kutta 2, Kutta 4.. what’s the difference?

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Reply Venkatesh says: January 16, 2016 at 9:17 am Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:36 am For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well. Reply Hardik Agarwal says: March 27, 2016 at 12:44 pm URGENT : If I don’t have an important document that has to be shown during the interview process in original (as said in the call letter), can I show its copy and give an undertaking of that? Will it work or will they cancel my candidature? Thanks in advance. Reply Madhur Modi says: April 20, 2016 at 10:04 am The interviews are already over. I think you would have already received the instructions from the panel about this Reply subhodeep says: April 19, 2016 at 10:28 am hi, i converted my PGDBA call. i am looking forward to join this course and very optimistic about it. just need to convince myself that avg salary will be equivalent to PGDM of IIMC. how is the industry perceiving this course. are companies like BCG and MCG lined up for PGDBA? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:00 pm Hi.. did you join the course?? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:01 pm What was last year’s cut-off to get the admissions?

Himanshu Goyal About the author: B. Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering from IIT Delhi – worked in Global Analytics (short-term loan provider in UK) for 5 years within collection analytics and risk analytics teams. There have been a lot of posts around the vision and scope of the program so I am not going to touch upon that for now. Instead, I am going to share my first-hand experience of the events in the first week – the orientation week – and how they affected my perception. Whenever we meet a stranger, we need an icebreaker to get things started. And that was the way the orientation week was designed. If there is one thing that repeatedly gets focussed on here at IIM-C, it is that you need to build your network. I had a fair deal of interactions with various groups. There were sessions with Deans, Program Founders, Professors, Seniors and last but not the least, multiple industry leaders. The sessions were designed to make the students more aware of the program, in terms of what the students should expect from it as well as what the professors and industries expected from its graduates. Not only did these sessions made me more informed, but I also learnt a few concepts in this week itself before the classes had even started! Interaction with Professors : There were multiple types of interactions with professors. In one of them, Deans and Senior Professors of the three institutes talked about the genesis of the program and how the geography of the three institutes fitted in perfectly to start it. It was heart-warming to see how each of them would compliment each other’s institution when their own was one of the best in its field. In another session, professors of the Organisational Behaviour course conducted a class exercise – Lost@C. While I won’t go into what it was, it would suffice to say that it was not only fun, but it also made me think on how to work better as a team. A session on how to solve case studies was organised as well. It was a very interactive session and I was encouraged to think and ask questions. All said and done, that my next 2 years were in the hands of capable professors. Interaction with Seniors : This was something each one of my batch was looking forward to. All of us had come from different backgrounds and we had questions – a significant number of them. The interaction started with introductions from both the batches. It then shifted to academic structure, the life at different campuses and the opportunities in the industry. There were a bunch of fundas from their end out of which I don’t remember much; but the key takeaway for me was that there is a huge demand in the industry for people having the right blend of technical skills and business acumen and this course perfectly bridges that gap. A large number of people have their eyes on how first few batches are performing and hence it will be up to us on how much we can push ourselves because the opportunity to gain knowledge in the three institutes is endless. Interaction with Industries : Companies were indeed looking forward to interact which was evident in the first week itself. Among them were – LatentView, PWC, KPMG, Deloitte and few others. What was striking to see was that despite belonging to diverse backgrounds, all of them had same expectations – the graduates from this course will be able to solve crucial business problems using data which will be analysed through various machine learning processes. Each of the companies highlighted the need for data scientists in today’s world because of the amount of data being generated and how it can be filled with us if we have the right mindset. It was also heartening to know that machine learning was now being applied to almost every domain (even agriculture); one just has to have an inquisitive mind to ask the right questions. I clearly remember a quote from one of such sessions, “Size of data is not the thing, but what you do with it.” Orientation day @ISI: As part of the orientation program, we also spent one day at ISI Kolkata and interacted with the professors there. At first look, ISI is an unassuming college (specially after going from IIM which has 7 lakes inside its campus!!). However, it is second to none when it comes to the faculty. One can easily find that each of the faculty is a gem by going through their profile and I cannot possible complete this article without mentioning Prof. Bimal Roy – A Padma Shri awardee, Master Cryptologist, Ex-Director at ISI – it can go on and on. He took a brief session and shared his personal experiences related to analytics. His way of telling stories really connected with me. He added a new dimension of problem solving techniques in my mind in that short session itself. . I already knew that ISI was going to play a unique role in this program because of its unparalleled specialisation in statistics and the one day spent there made me even more excited to start my studies. Given that the program is in its development stage, I had made a conscious choice and took a leap of faith while deciding to join the course. I had belief in the system, but was still apprehensive about industry expectations, and how will the institutes coordinate among themselves. These interactions, in one way or another, not only helped in soothing down my nerves but also made me even more excited and motivated to do well and make this program a success. As Abraham Lincoln once said, The best way to predict your future is to create it .

Feb 1, 2021 — by pgdba_admin in Uncategorized PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

The aim is to provide a general idea about the profile of the students and their respective interview experiences to help aspirants prepare better for the big day. PS – The interview panel consisted of three members. Bharathi Ramaraj – B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering; International Chess Player “I introduced myself as a chess player. And the first thing that followed was why I wanted to pursue Analytics, being a chess player. I said, I wanted to make an impact, also decision making plays a big role in analytics thus being a chess player gives me the apt mindset in the field. I gave real-life examples where I used chess playing skills and also highlighted my enthusiasm towards chess by describing how I view situations as a chessboard and how I involve members as pieces playing the game. The panelists gave me new situations to test my viewpoint by letting me turn the interview into a game of chess where the panelists and I were pieces on the board. I took up the problem and described various strategies that I had at my disposal. I spoke at length about the best strategy that I would deploy to win the game. They also asked about the factors which led me to pursue analytics like my placement in an analytics company and why I wanted to complete postgraduate studies. To this I replied, doing it now would help me save time and gain an early advantage which will be very valuable in the long run. My interview was relatively short compared to other candidates.” ****** Shashank Kumar -B.Tech in EEE , 2.5+ years of experience in VLSI design “I was the first person to be interviewed at my center. The conversation started with current affairs and the morning news. The analytics projects during my engineering were heavily focused upon. Technical questions included topics like probability, regression, various types of regression and analysis of the quality of fit based on residual plots. The interview spanned around 15 minutes. In hindsight, I think it was a pretty short interview” ****** Sajal Jain – Class representative (PGDBA 2015-2017),B.Tech in Civil Engineering with 4 years of experience in software industry “My interview wasn’t strictly a technical one. The few questions included questions on differentiability and continuity and other basic mathematical concepts. My interview majorly focused on how, in my view, my background of civil engineer with more than 4 years of experience in software industry would indulge in a career in analytics and add a different value and perspectives to the batch. The questions were not at all tough so I would advise the candidates to be firm in their basics” ****** Ayan Sengupta , a fresher who has done BSc and MSc in mathematics and computing “Having a background different from most of the other candidates, my interview was naturally quite unique in its own way. I expected a tough line of questioning from the panelists but my interview consisted of aptitude questions such as how I would find a method for the CEO of the company I work in to cross a river given that he doesn’t know swimming. There were also other puzzles such as – Why manholes are round and simple mathematical questions covering number theory . The interview was around 20-25 minutes long.” ****** Shoorvir Gupta , a fresher in mechanical engineering and an IES aspirant “My interview started with the description of my college and grades. I mentioned my college life and how I became inclined towards gaming, had all A’s in technical subjects, very high CAT score and a 10 pointer in internship. The rest of the interview was focused on IES and related questions to various fields in IES, questions on strength of material and on boilers and its parts (mechanical subjects). Technical questions were mostly around probability and statistics and its applications. Towards the end of the interview they also asked about my background and hometown related questions.” ****** Ritwik Prashant , a fresher with B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and amongst the most meticulous students within the batch “I started with my introduction and how I was in touch with analytics (Coursera courses). I also described my interests in fantasy football where one has to apply optimizations and statistics in decision making. Technical questions were based around matrices where they made a deep dive until they touched unfamiliar topics. Being a fresher from IIT Madras, they also questioned me about my college placement and my orientation towards this course rather than taking up a job. Thus my entire interview was based on the initial steer I had provided with my introduction.” ****** Pranita Khandelwal , a fresher with dual degree (EEE and Economics) “The interview started off with the recurring question about my degrees- how I ended up studying both Economics and EEE. Later, I was tested on my knowledge of econometrics, and the panel asked some conceptual questions on linear regression and decision making using hypothesis testing. This was followed by questions related to my projects and internships .” ****** Avinash Kumar, a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience “I steered my interview with my introduction towards my college project at USA and my job profile description. The questions covered as to how I could apply data analytics to these projects and how other projects such as six sigma projects are related to analytics. Among technical questions, most of them were based on geometry and also tested my creativity and open mindedness. I had applied through GATE and was oriented towards aerodynamics so I mentioned why I wanted to pursue an analytics career and implement analytics in aerodynamics sector. I highlighted my orientation with awards (NASA system engineering award-1st prize) and description of college project. Even though most of the other candidates had 15 minute interviews that day, mine was a lengthy 35 minute one.” ****** Mukul Kumar , a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience and with same background as Avinash Kumar “Just like Avinash, I steered my interview with my introduction towards why I wanted to pursue analytics. I mentioned how I had researched and gained opinion about analytics from my peers and seniors and felt that the course aligns with my interests in mathematics and thus I can do justice to the course. Technical questions included mathematical ones (hyperbolic functions and their graphs, differentiation,1st differentiation principle and limit) but none on mechanical engineering. I had also applied through GATE and was asked the interview calls I had received. There were also questions based on puzzles and a few questions from written test which we had given during the pre-interview process.” ****** Sujan Biswas – BSc and MSc in chemistry, 2.75 years of experience in Banking and financial services “My panelists began with questions about my background and current job profile and drifted over to mathematical questions covering even and odd functions and matrices. Other questions included optimization based questions and decision making problems such as the methods and parameters one would use to determine whether to provide a loan to an individual or not. There were also situational problems such as – Given that Ph.D students have a higher default rate but high profits and MBA students have lower default rate and lower profits, how would you define your business. Overall my interview was nice and the panelists were not grilling.” ****** Mohammed Tariq , B.Tech in computer science in engineering, 10 months of experience in Business intelligence “Prior to joining the course, I described my experience of a 6-month certification course in analytics. I was also asked about statistics. They asked in-depth questions on calculus going to the levels at which I could not solve. Since I have already done a PG course which used R programming language, Tableau tool and projects, I answered what subjects I learned during the course, experience of the course and my development of interest in PGDBA after completing the course. The interview was mainly focused on my interests in analytics.” Analytics Experience IIM Calcutta Interview PGDBA Student Life students Post navigation Next Article Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge Previous Article PGDBA Interview Experiences – Part 2 Related Articles Interview Experiences PGDBA 2025-27 Interview Experiences Greetings, Future PGDBA Achievers!

Online test preparation packages. RC99 and CAT previous papers for the verbal part. Tips for Application Form & Interview I would suggest getting to know the program better. If you are really interested in analytics, then only devote your time to prepare. If you don’t have an analytics background, I would suggest you find something in your job where data is generated and how it can be used. They might not ask questions related to machine learning or coding, but they will test your understanding of the current job and your application of the data in your field. Importance of different topics for the interview- Job profile>Maths and statistics>GK, Current affairs. Even if you have a job profile similar to mine, you wonâ€™t get similar questions as me. Interview experiences can be very specific according to the candidate and the panel number. Do read a lot of interview experiences to get an idea about the types of question asked and prepare accordingly. Practice routine questions and try to give mock interviews if possible. Prior Coding experience No Any alternate programs (MBA/MS/MTech) you were enrolled in while considering PGDBA? (If yes, please specify program and college) None General Interview Questions: Profile-based I was working as a Production Engineer in ONGC, Hazira. Almost all my questions were based on my working profile. Most of these questions were asked by panelist from IIT-KGP and a couple from ISI panelist. Following types of questions were asked- 1. What is your current role in ONGC? 2. What types of value-added products are produced in ONGC Hazira- told, then we had a further discussion related to one of the units- LPG unit. 3. What type of quality parameters, different data generated related to that unit. I did a small self-project related to LPG unit during my time in ONGC which was very helpful in the interview as most of the time was spent on that. Interview Questions: Mathematics & Statistics based I was asked only two questions related to Statistics by an ISI panelist after some discussion about my self-project. 1. You have some numerical data. If you add an outlier to that data, which one of the measures of central tendencies will affect the most? (Mean) The panelist asked first if I knew the measures of central tendency. (Mean, Median, Mode) 2. Basic application of Central Limit Theorem. From a population, you are taking some sampling data (80-90 samples I donâ€™t remember exactly), so how will you calculate the mean of the population? I mentioned CLT and then he asked what is the CLT? I told him the basic definition and he was satisfied and my interview was over. Interview Questions: Machine Learning/ Coding based None GK & current affairs Interview questions (If any, please specify) None Miscellaneous Interview Questions Questions asked by IIMC panelist at the start- 1. Tell me about yourself. 2. You are currently working at ONGC. You have a good job and further scope in your field then why do you want to leave ONGC? I told him I did some basic courses in data analytics online which got me very interested in the field so I want to learn more and change my profile. 3. So if you have decided you are going to leave such a high-paying job, did you do any financial analysis on this? I told them frankly I don’t know how to do financial analysis yet. I added further that I am not focusing on what I am leaving. I am looking forward to learning analytics and the opportunities I will have after that. The IIM C panelist said-fair enough and did not ask any follow-up questions on that and moved on to questions related to my hobby. Can you tell me the difference between Pool and Snooker? Who is the current snooker world champion? What do you do besides playing snooker? Any other hobby. I answered the first two well. Just fumbled a bit and tried to provide extra details on the second question which should’ve been avoided. In the end, I said I don’t get enough time for snooker so I don’t have another hobby. The panelist smiled and asked the IIT-KGP panelist to take over.

This followed up with – ISI Prof – define Business Analysis? How to ensure data is reliable for prediction and how to fill missing data? He asked me to convince him to invest in Tata Steel Stock and then gave me a simple P&C math problem and tested me on how confident I’m on the answer. At last asked me who is the present minister of steel and education for which I said I don’t know after the recent reshuffle. Interview Questions: Mathematics & Statistics based As I said, ISI Prof asked a question on simple math P&C and tested my confidence by reiterating the answer in different ways. IIT KGP Prof – Gave me a problem on conditional probability (I mentioned that I had training on analytics before covid in Tata Steel by a ISI Prof – an MoU program of Tata Steel with ISI K), attempted but made a mistake then hinted this is based on some condition. Then I identified that this was a problem on Bayes Theorem, explained the approach but couldn’t solve it. He appreciated that I heard about Bayes theorem and then asked me questions on axioms of probability for which initially I fumbled but he connected the missing points while I’m answering and appreciated again that I know about the axioms and concepts. Interview Questions: Machine Learning/ Coding based Nope GK & current affairs Interview questions (If any, please specify) IIM C Prof – Asked me my favorite news topic, for which I said I read all types of news. Then she asked me what the headlines of Today’s Newspaper. Luckily I had glanced at the Economic Times newspaper that day and remembered a lady holding an umbrella at the funeral (9/11, which was my interview day as well). Told her this and a title about the Afghan war. Asked me how both are connected, told the whole story. Asked me what will be the impact on India (Afghan war) and finally asked me impact regarding investment point of view. Answered all and could sense she was impressed.

The aim is to provide a general idea about the profile of the students and their respective interview experiences to help aspirants prepare better for the big day. PS – The interview panel consisted of three members. Bharathi Ramaraj – B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering; International Chess Player “I introduced myself as a chess player. And the first thing that followed was why I wanted to pursue Analytics, being a chess player. I said, I wanted to make an impact, also decision making plays a big role in analytics thus being a chess player gives me the apt mindset in the field. I gave real-life examples where I used chess playing skills and also highlighted my enthusiasm towards chess by describing how I view situations as a chessboard and how I involve members as pieces playing the game. The panelists gave me new situations to test my viewpoint by letting me turn the interview into a game of chess where the panelists and I were pieces on the board. I took up the problem and described various strategies that I had at my disposal. I spoke at length about the best strategy that I would deploy to win the game. They also asked about the factors which led me to pursue analytics like my placement in an analytics company and why I wanted to complete postgraduate studies. To this I replied, doing it now would help me save time and gain an early advantage which will be very valuable in the long run. My interview was relatively short compared to other candidates.” ****** Shashank Kumar -B.Tech in EEE , 2.5+ years of experience in VLSI design “I was the first person to be interviewed at my center. The conversation started with current affairs and the morning news. The analytics projects during my engineering were heavily focused upon. Technical questions included topics like probability, regression, various types of regression and analysis of the quality of fit based on residual plots. The interview spanned around 15 minutes. In hindsight, I think it was a pretty short interview” ****** Sajal Jain – Class representative (PGDBA 2015-2017),B.Tech in Civil Engineering with 4 years of experience in software industry “My interview wasn’t strictly a technical one. The few questions included questions on differentiability and continuity and other basic mathematical concepts. My interview majorly focused on how, in my view, my background of civil engineer with more than 4 years of experience in software industry would indulge in a career in analytics and add a different value and perspectives to the batch. The questions were not at all tough so I would advise the candidates to be firm in their basics” ****** Ayan Sengupta , a fresher who has done BSc and MSc in mathematics and computing “Having a background different from most of the other candidates, my interview was naturally quite unique in its own way. I expected a tough line of questioning from the panelists but my interview consisted of aptitude questions such as how I would find a method for the CEO of the company I work in to cross a river given that he doesn’t know swimming. There were also other puzzles such as – Why manholes are round and simple mathematical questions covering number theory . The interview was around 20-25 minutes long.” ****** Shoorvir Gupta , a fresher in mechanical engineering and an IES aspirant “My interview started with the description of my college and grades. I mentioned my college life and how I became inclined towards gaming, had all A’s in technical subjects, very high CAT score and a 10 pointer in internship. The rest of the interview was focused on IES and related questions to various fields in IES, questions on strength of material and on boilers and its parts (mechanical subjects). Technical questions were mostly around probability and statistics and its applications. Towards the end of the interview they also asked about my background and hometown related questions.” ****** Ritwik Prashant , a fresher with B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and amongst the most meticulous students within the batch “I started with my introduction and how I was in touch with analytics (Coursera courses). I also described my interests in fantasy football where one has to apply optimizations and statistics in decision making. Technical questions were based around matrices where they made a deep dive until they touched unfamiliar topics. Being a fresher from IIT Madras, they also questioned me about my college placement and my orientation towards this course rather than taking up a job. Thus my entire interview was based on the initial steer I had provided with my introduction.” ****** Pranita Khandelwal , a fresher with dual degree (EEE and Economics) “The interview started off with the recurring question about my degrees- how I ended up studying both Economics and EEE. Later, I was tested on my knowledge of econometrics, and the panel asked some conceptual questions on linear regression and decision making using hypothesis testing. This was followed by questions related to my projects and internships .” ****** Avinash Kumar, a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience “I steered my interview with my introduction towards my college project at USA and my job profile description. The questions covered as to how I could apply data analytics to these projects and how other projects such as six sigma projects are related to analytics. Among technical questions, most of them were based on geometry and also tested my creativity and open mindedness. I had applied through GATE and was oriented towards aerodynamics so I mentioned why I wanted to pursue an analytics career and implement analytics in aerodynamics sector. I highlighted my orientation with awards (NASA system engineering award-1st prize) and description of college project. Even though most of the other candidates had 15 minute interviews that day, mine was a lengthy 35 minute one.” ****** Mukul Kumar , a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience and with same background as Avinash Kumar “Just like Avinash, I steered my interview with my introduction towards why I wanted to pursue analytics. I mentioned how I had researched and gained opinion about analytics from my peers and seniors and felt that the course aligns with my interests in mathematics and thus I can do justice to the course. Technical questions included mathematical ones (hyperbolic functions and their graphs, differentiation,1st differentiation principle and limit) but none on mechanical engineering. I had also applied through GATE and was asked the interview calls I had received. There were also questions based on puzzles and a few questions from written test which we had given during the pre-interview process.” ****** Sujan Biswas – BSc and MSc in chemistry, 2.75 years of experience in Banking and financial services “My panelists began with questions about my background and current job profile and drifted over to mathematical questions covering even and odd functions and matrices. Other questions included optimization based questions and decision making problems such as the methods and parameters one would use to determine whether to provide a loan to an individual or not. There were also situational problems such as – Given that Ph.D students have a higher default rate but high profits and MBA students have lower default rate and lower profits, how would you define your business. Overall my interview was nice and the panelists were not grilling.” ****** Mohammed Tariq , B.Tech in computer science in engineering, 10 months of experience in Business intelligence “Prior to joining the course, I described my experience of a 6-month certification course in analytics. I was also asked about statistics. They asked in-depth questions on calculus going to the levels at which I could not solve. Since I have already done a PG course which used R programming language, Tableau tool and projects, I answered what subjects I learned during the course, experience of the course and my development of interest in PGDBA after completing the course. The interview was mainly focused on my interests in analytics.” Analytics Experience IIM Calcutta Interview PGDBA Student Life students Post navigation Next Article Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge Previous Article PGDBA Interview Experiences – Part 2 Related Articles Interview Experiences PGDBA 2025-27 Interview Experiences Greetings, Future PGDBA Achievers!

It seems a bit confusing at the start but soon one gets fascinated by it. The fact that each aspect of business analytics is taught by a specialized institute seems like a perfect horses-for-courses strategy. When I first heard about it, there was one name out of the three which captured my imagination the most and made me take this course seriously. That was ISI Kolkata – the pinnacle for statisticians. It is not to say that IIT Kharagpur and IIM Calcutta are insignificant names – popularity-wise that would be opposite – but the fact that an institute which is known more for its research-oriented approach, and not for focussing on fat pay checks, was a part of this curriculum made me think that I might actually learn something in this course and not just bide my time until the placement season. Hence I can say that ISI is one of the primary reasons for me being in this course. Now that the ISI phase is over I feel it imperative to share my experience. Due to space constraints, I will limit this article to my academic experience and not the student life there. We studied 5 courses there and though I will not be able to do justice to each of them in this short space, I will try my best to give an overview of what we studied in each course. 1. Stochastic Processes and its Applications : Randomness is the true foundation of mathematics. – Gregory Chaitin This course can be thought of as 3-in-1. It started with probability problems (check out gambler’s ruin problem if gambling is your thing), their ingenious solutions and then expanded to probability distributions. In almost no time at all, we shifted gears from simple coin tosses to complex problems involving combinations of probability and calculus. When we got done with it all in one month, we found out that it was a precursor to stochastic processes. We then spent a good amount of time studying Markov chains which has innumerable practical applications in today’s world (Google’s PageRank algorithm). If that was not enough in one semester, we also got an introduction to time series forecasting in final stages of the course. Probability, Stochastic Processes and Time Series forecasting – All three have the potential to be a separate course in themselves for one whole semester. While we couldn’t cover each one of them extensively, the course was a good starting point for someone looking for further studies in this area. It also covered enough of the three sub-topics so that we wouldn’t be sitting ducks when facing practical problems in this subject. 2. Statistical Structures in Data : Statistics is the grammar of science. – Karl Pearson Arguably the most important course of the semester. This course dwelled into pure statistics which started from simple properties of a distribution such as mean, median, variance, etc. We then moved to solve regression problems which started from univariate and culminated in multivariate statistics. This course also introduced us to various concepts in machine learning such as PCA, Factor Analysis, GLM and Decision Trees. Don’t worry if all these terms look Chinese to you, many of us weren’t aware of it either before stepping into ISI. Going by the internship interview experience of the first batch of PGDBA, it was considered to be the most important course. I believe that is because being a data analyst is not about being able to run a code in a software, rather it is about understanding the concepts behind the scenes and use that to extract maximum information. This course does exactly that. 3. Inferences: It is a hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow; and this means that we do not know whether it will rise. – Ludwig Wittgenstein English is never going to be the same for you once you attend this course. This course gave a glimpse into how technical can one get into statistics. We found that many things which would seem a mere nuisance to a ‘normal’ person actually have a lot of difference when it comes to statistics. Likelihood and Probability take on a new meaning altogether; Parameter, Statistic, Estimator and Estimate will always seem like a case of so-near-yet-so-far. We also covered the concept of hypothesis testing and its applications. Any statistics-101 book will have these topics and this particular course coupled with the one above forms the crux for which one comes to ISI. It is quite easy to commit mistakes in statistics by missing out on one or two seemingly trivial assumptions. This course taught us to be really careful with what we state and what we assume. At the same time, it taught us concepts which have direct applications in the real world and in the realm of statistics. 4. Computing for Data Sciences (CDS) : Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid; humans are slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are powerful beyond imagination. – Leo Cherne (This quote is often wrongly attributed to Einstein) One of my batch-mates has already written a whole article dedicated to this course and its faculty. And the reason for that is simple – We learnt the most in this course. This course takes you on a journey of data science where you become fascinated by it. Each one of our classes was focussed on one topic and the number of topics we ended up covering in the entire semester was humongous. If coverage of so much theory wasn’t enough, we also had hands-on sessions in class on R. This was also the only course in ISI in which we did a complete data science project from scratch. You can find the list of projects done by 2016 batch here (and here for 2015 batch). We have spent one month at IIT KGP and we are already seeing the benefits of what we covered in CDS. Having got a glimpse into the multitude of topics earlier, it is now much easier for us to get into the flow of each topic which are being taught in separate courses. 5. Fundamentals of Database Systems : Unless structure follows strategy, inefficiency results. – Alfred D. Chandler This was probably the least thought-out course of the five in this semester. And that worked both ways for us. We finished the stipulated curriculum halfway through the semester and hence the faculty left it unto us what we wanted to cover. Students suggested the topics and were duly obliged. The first half of semester got us acquainted with MySQL. We then studied normalization of databases in detail which talked about how an efficient and accurate database can be designed. We also studied Information Retrieval, MapReduce and Market-basket model in the latter half of semester. In total, we spent exactly 4 months at ISI. That is by no means sufficient amount of time to get the maximum potential out of that place but you make peace with what you get. The learning at ISI was unique at the very least and it provided the perfect kick start we needed in this course. We covered a breadth of topics in a couple of courses and went into depth as well wherever necessary. These courses have laid a solid foundation and now we are in a position to apply these concepts and see if we can really make the data speak. The first and the hardest step has been taken. Now is the time to cover the distance.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Maunish Shah December 22, 2015 Reply Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? pgdbaunofficial December 16, 2015 Reply There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. sarthak aggarwal December 29, 2015 Reply sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Mbs January 1, 2016 Reply What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 ankit gupta January 12, 2016 Reply can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Venkatesh January 16, 2016 Reply Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well. Hardik Agarwal March 27, 2016 Reply URGENT : If I don’t have an important document that has to be shown during the interview process in original (as said in the call letter), can I show its copy and give an undertaking of that? Will it work or will they cancel my candidature? Thanks in advance. Madhur Modi April 20, 2016 Reply The interviews are already over. I think you would have already received the instructions from the panel about this subhodeep April 19, 2016 Reply hi, i converted my PGDBA call. i am looking forward to join this course and very optimistic about it. just need to convince myself that avg salary will be equivalent to PGDM of IIMC. how is the industry perceiving this course. are companies like BCG and MCG lined up for PGDBA? abhaydeepiws1 November 1, 2016 Reply Hi.. did you join the course?? abhaydeepiws1 November 1, 2016 Reply What was last year’s cut-off to get the admissions?

PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta ; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur . PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

The procedure to apply for admission to the PGDBA batch of 2021-2023 will be available here: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/how-apply We strongly recommend you to go through the admission policy here before applying: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/programs/pgdba/admissions/admission-policy-2021-23-batch 2) What are the topics that are expected to covered in the written test? How do I prepare for the test? Is the test of JEE/CAT/XAT level? The syllabus for a previous written test is mentioned here: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/instruction-syllabus We do not have an official set of study materials recommended for the test. However, you can look through the sample paper here: https://www.isical.ac.in/~pgdba/Documents/SampleQuestion2020.pdf , to assess the difficulty level of the test. The actual paper would be fairly close to this set of questions. The set of topics and the sample paper together should help you prepare for the test. Further, they would help you assess the level of the test, in comparison to other tests. 3) What kind of questions can I expect in the interview? The interview mostly revolves around your basic understanding of statistics, probability and a few other relevant mathematical concepts, your work experience and your motivation to join the program. There may also be questions on other aspects of your profile, some latest events and so on. Here are a few interview experiences of the students from 2020-2022 batch that should give you a fair idea of what to expect: https://aspirants.pgdba.ml/2021/04/03/pgdba-interview-experiences-2020-22/ 4) Is my profile good enough to make it to the program? As long as you fulfill the basic eligibility criteria, your final selection comes down to your profile (including your academics and your work experience), your score in the written test and in the interview, and additionally, the pool of candidates applying with you, given the limited number of seats. 5) What are the expected cut-offs for various categories (General, SC/ST, NC-OBC) for the written test? The institutes do not disclose this information. However, you may know your score in the written test by dropping a mail to the admissions office, post the test. 6) Which of the three institutes awards the degree? The final degree is awarded jointly by all three institutes: IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata.

December 18, 2015 pgdba_admin Campus Life 5 Comments Here comes our atta boy, our cheerful Madhur Modi to speak about our first semester at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. He is a CS grad, tinted with the experience of working in Acrobat Team, Adobe, India for 11 months. Let’s hear what Madhur says! After a not-so long orientation and pre-semester at IIM C, it was time to move to ISI. All of us were already feeling the attachment we had built with each other and formed the spirit of ‘joka tribe’ within ourselves. We started our journey to learn and started packing… but we were not done with the pre-semester yet! 🙂 Not before we can have a last photo-session! Even the journey to ISI was an insightful one! Filled with discussions of memories made within the short month. Happy faces! I remember us all at the peak of our enthusiasm when we visited ISI for the first time after the orientation, this time for around 6 months with knowledge imparted from renowned teachers. Since each of us had opted for the hostel facilities, the registration day was spent in lodging and document formalities. It all began with 5 subjects, 8 teachers and 51 students – daily two hour classes, twice daily where a moment of flickering attention meant you’ll lose the ability to grasp anything for the rest of the class. Yes! We had teachers who could teach us their subject continuously for two hours and every moment… each of them they made us wonder how amazing it is to learn in an enjoyable fashion. We all felt so comfortable moving from our 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional minds to nth dimensions and then move down using multidimensional scaling ☺ ☺ (was I too technical here? Come to ISI and you’ll know what I mean). I bet all our teachers from ISI would be laughing reading the joke here. By the ways, if you’re writing about ISI, it won’t be a just article if you do not mention each teacher separately! Starting from our class teacher and DBMS teacher prof. Pinakpani Pal, it was him who would come to our rescue each time, whether it is to change the mess, requirement of any additional facilities, aid in any procedures or help regarding the subject. He would kindly reach out his hand and solve all our problems in a flick. DBMS was also taught by prof. Amiya and prof. Dilip who would take care of SQL teaching for us. Thanks to him, DBMS was one of the most comfortable subjects in ISI. I still remember the fact that 44 teachers have bhattacharya awards in their name! We all used to marvel at the level of knowledge at ISI, rather, we felt grateful to our teachers for feeding such golden nuggets of information to us daily and Prof. Debasis is the teacher who’s teaching reminded us the reasons they won those awards. I always felt that he teaches one subject but I learned things anyone would consider is worth much more! From histograms, scatter plots, distributions and tests for distributions, he took us to bivariate and the multivariate analysis followed by more tests and feature selection. Moreover, he took extra classes and doubt sessions every week just to ensure that when we learn, we learn well When you start talking about the teachers, each teacher is better than the other! We had Statistical Probabilistic Analysis taught by two teachers, Prof. Bimal and Prof. Kishan. It was the only subject with no assignments, since probability has such a wide scope. This class was all practical, we were given real life examples and applied concepts to solve them. There was yet another similar subject, inference, taught by Prof. Amitava which encompassed all other subjects and drew inference tests from each of them, filled with more real life examples. We had one more course, or rather, set of course ☺ Computing in data science taught by Prof. Saurav Sengupta. I could proudly say to those non-cse students who fear how they would learn programming techniques- this is the course that will help you make your first transition. From practically negligible knowledge, this course taught us not just R and Python, but also made us do an entire team project to deep seat the lessons in our hearts. The best thing? We had fun! I would frequently visit the course website and our project blog and proudly say that we have come far, far from where we were when we entered ISI. P.S. do check out the blog of group 1 authored by our group. 🙂 Didn’t I mention anything else besides studies? How forgetful of me! ISI is a place of happenings! Every other day there were announcements of workshops in various fields of statistics and there were a variety of activities which would now be sweet memories for us with ISI. We flew kites, we had birthday parties, we played games and we had our first formal photoshoot! Looking smart! ISI also had a very special memory… Diwali! What’s that? How did we celebrate it? I could boast that it was better than any student had celebrated while at college! Two of our batchmates, Mr. Avinash (a.k.a. Gandhi) and Mukul cleaned their room and turned it into the Pooja venue (see photos in link) We made diyas, did Pooja, sang bhakti songs, distributed Prasad and made rangoli ! We burnt a few crackers and all our rooms illuminated with the auspiciousness on that day! It was one of the best Diwali celebrations of my life! Diwali! Soon after Durga puja, Diwali and Kali puja, we had our final exams and had to say “Bye Bye ISI” I am thankful that our first semester was conducted at ISI where we learnt such a great deal and progressed so far ahead in our skills. It already feels like we can do most of business analytics even though we have ways to go. How could be go away without saying a delightful adios to our Indian Statistical institute? We requested all the teachers to come for a final photoshoot session. Besides one photo present in CDS website , another photo from the last day would mark a fitting ending to our memories and knowledge lending roller coaster ride at the pillar of statistical, mathematical and machine learning institute! Adios!

I hope you have applied! ABHISHEK AGRAWAL January 19, 2016 Reply I have applied for the test. Could you please tell me what to expect in interview from your experience as i have around 2 months to prepare for it. Madhur Modi January 20, 2016 Reply At this point, do focus on the written test first. You should again be prepared with mathematics for the interview as well. Most of the other questions besides maths are similar to a typical IIM interview. You will need to prepare additional topics as well such as probability and differentiation. Based on your profile, some specific questions might be asked. Also, stay tuned for future posts on the blog where we may post further insights!

The procedure to apply for admission to the PGDBA batch of 2021-2023 will be available here: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/how-apply We strongly recommend you to go through the admission policy here before applying: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/programs/pgdba/admissions/admission-policy-2021-23-batch 2) What are the topics that are expected to covered in the written test? How do I prepare for the test? Is the test of JEE/CAT/XAT level? The syllabus for a previous written test is mentioned here: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/instruction-syllabus We do not have an official set of study materials recommended for the test. However, you can look through the sample paper here: https://www.isical.ac.in/~pgdba/Documents/SampleQuestion2020.pdf , to assess the difficulty level of the test. The actual paper would be fairly close to this set of questions. The set of topics and the sample paper together should help you prepare for the test. Further, they would help you assess the level of the test, in comparison to other tests. 3) What kind of questions can I expect in the interview? The interview mostly revolves around your basic understanding of statistics, probability and a few other relevant mathematical concepts, your work experience and your motivation to join the program. There may also be questions on other aspects of your profile, some latest events and so on. Here are a few interview experiences of the students from 2020-2022 batch that should give you a fair idea of what to expect: https://aspirants.pgdba.ml/2021/04/03/pgdba-interview-experiences-2020-22/ 4) Is my profile good enough to make it to the program? As long as you fulfill the basic eligibility criteria, your final selection comes down to your profile (including your academics and your work experience), your score in the written test and in the interview, and additionally, the pool of candidates applying with you, given the limited number of seats. 5) What are the expected cut-offs for various categories (General, SC/ST, NC-OBC) for the written test? The institutes do not disclose this information. However, you may know your score in the written test by dropping a mail to the admissions office, post the test. 6) Which of the three institutes awards the degree? The final degree is awarded jointly by all three institutes: IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata.

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

And to all those who couldn’t. I’ve jumped ships. I’ve made the leap. I am now a part of what they call Tata Hall- the luxurious guesthouse at IIM C, when I used to be a part of what they called Himadri (my IIT Delhi hostel). I am convinced that recording my first impressions of this maddening, surreal odyssey that I have set out on will not only prove to be fruitful in retrospect, but in fact help me in retaining my sanity in the present. For those of you who have been wondering what I’m going to blabber about, I would like to give you some context before you abandon me. I am now a student at the PGDBA program. I am comfortably living in my posh suite of the guesthouse of IIM C, with my amazing roommate, situated in Joka, which is nearly thirty kilometers away from the city of Kolkata. There are one hundred and three other students in this program who live with me, so I am sometimes tempted to forget that we are literally in the middle of nowhere. We are being fed an illusion – but an irresistible one that I don’t have the heart to snap out of. In some ways, the fact that the city is beyond my reach is liberating. The five years I spent living in the heart of Delhi, and then another two years in the legendary city of Mumbai, I craved for an escape, for a way out. I think this program has finally answered my call for help. Here, I am constantly told that I am special, that I am the chosen one. The twenty-four years of my life that have led to this moment have made me so cynical that I doubt their belief in me. But at the same time, I greatly value it. After a very long time, I am around people who are willing to invest in my future simply because the three accomplished panel members saw a spark in me, during the twenty-five minutes I spent interviewing for the program. I feel humbled and terrified. The two years ahead are going to demand every inch of me, it is going to consume me, and it is going to change me. But for so long I have felt nothing, that this rush, this constant buzz in my head, this restlessness feels good. I am sleep-deprived, surviving on n number of cups of terribly made tea and coffee and hopping from one assignment to the other with some extended breaks thankfully, and yet, I am alive. How often is it that you are so committed to the moment that every other structure inside and outside your mind breaks form, and this particular moment is all that you can see, all that you can register? This program is one such moment in my life. The program, which aims at producing a team of unparalleled business analysts and data scientists, supposedly the sexiest job in the market these days, has been ideated by the three premiere institutes of India – Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This very credibility generates the “Pygmalion effect” and drives me to excel in the area of analytics. The coming two years make me realize, that I’m far away from the comfort zone and stability that life had offered just before I decided to enroll into PGDBA. But I am also glad that it happened, for I can now appreciate the morning for what it truly represents – a fresh start. I like the concept of this new beginning, for it brings with it the exciting journey of exploring new dimensions and reconstruct your identity. I am tempted to fantasize about the future, but I am trying to contain my excitement to the moment. So many paths seem to call out to me that my brain will explode if I start to think too much. What do I want, you ask? Organized chaos. If you think that is romantically abstract, then you have understood me just a little more than you did before you began to read this note. I will end with a few lines that so perfectly describe my state of mind right now, that I might just marry Robert Frost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. ← Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge → The Best Laid Schemes, of Spiders and Men!

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

Himanshu Goyal About the author: B. Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering from IIT Delhi – worked in Global Analytics (short-term loan provider in UK) for 5 years within collection analytics and risk analytics teams. There have been a lot of posts around the vision and scope of the program so I am not going to touch upon that for now. Instead, I am going to share my first-hand experience of the events in the first week – the orientation week – and how they affected my perception. Whenever we meet a stranger, we need an icebreaker to get things started. And that was the way the orientation week was designed. If there is one thing that repeatedly gets focussed on here at IIM-C, it is that you need to build your network. I had a fair deal of interactions with various groups. There were sessions with Deans, Program Founders, Professors, Seniors and last but not the least, multiple industry leaders. The sessions were designed to make the students more aware of the program, in terms of what the students should expect from it as well as what the professors and industries expected from its graduates. Not only did these sessions made me more informed, but I also learnt a few concepts in this week itself before the classes had even started! Interaction with Professors : There were multiple types of interactions with professors. In one of them, Deans and Senior Professors of the three institutes talked about the genesis of the program and how the geography of the three institutes fitted in perfectly to start it. It was heart-warming to see how each of them would compliment each other’s institution when their own was one of the best in its field. In another session, professors of the Organisational Behaviour course conducted a class exercise – Lost@C. While I won’t go into what it was, it would suffice to say that it was not only fun, but it also made me think on how to work better as a team. A session on how to solve case studies was organised as well. It was a very interactive session and I was encouraged to think and ask questions. All said and done, that my next 2 years were in the hands of capable professors. Interaction with Seniors : This was something each one of my batch was looking forward to. All of us had come from different backgrounds and we had questions – a significant number of them. The interaction started with introductions from both the batches. It then shifted to academic structure, the life at different campuses and the opportunities in the industry. There were a bunch of fundas from their end out of which I don’t remember much; but the key takeaway for me was that there is a huge demand in the industry for people having the right blend of technical skills and business acumen and this course perfectly bridges that gap. A large number of people have their eyes on how first few batches are performing and hence it will be up to us on how much we can push ourselves because the opportunity to gain knowledge in the three institutes is endless. Interaction with Industries : Companies were indeed looking forward to interact which was evident in the first week itself. Among them were – LatentView, PWC, KPMG, Deloitte and few others. What was striking to see was that despite belonging to diverse backgrounds, all of them had same expectations – the graduates from this course will be able to solve crucial business problems using data which will be analysed through various machine learning processes. Each of the companies highlighted the need for data scientists in today’s world because of the amount of data being generated and how it can be filled with us if we have the right mindset. It was also heartening to know that machine learning was now being applied to almost every domain (even agriculture); one just has to have an inquisitive mind to ask the right questions. I clearly remember a quote from one of such sessions, “Size of data is not the thing, but what you do with it.” Orientation day @ISI: As part of the orientation program, we also spent one day at ISI Kolkata and interacted with the professors there. At first look, ISI is an unassuming college (specially after going from IIM which has 7 lakes inside its campus!!). However, it is second to none when it comes to the faculty. One can easily find that each of the faculty is a gem by going through their profile and I cannot possible complete this article without mentioning Prof. Bimal Roy – A Padma Shri awardee, Master Cryptologist, Ex-Director at ISI – it can go on and on. He took a brief session and shared his personal experiences related to analytics. His way of telling stories really connected with me. He added a new dimension of problem solving techniques in my mind in that short session itself. . I already knew that ISI was going to play a unique role in this program because of its unparalleled specialisation in statistics and the one day spent there made me even more excited to start my studies. Given that the program is in its development stage, I had made a conscious choice and took a leap of faith while deciding to join the course. I had belief in the system, but was still apprehensive about industry expectations, and how will the institutes coordinate among themselves. These interactions, in one way or another, not only helped in soothing down my nerves but also made me even more excited and motivated to do well and make this program a success. As Abraham Lincoln once said, The best way to predict your future is to create it .

Adhikari Vushesh Babu – Dual Degree ( B. Tech. + M. Tech.) in Information Technology, ABV IIITM Gwalior, 2016 Duration: 40 mins HR question about the following scenario- Let’s assume many companies are willing to visit your college this year and you are made the placement representative for your batch. What Steps would you take so that you will get all the credit for your batch placements and not placement season? List some of your initiatives which you think will help you in taking that credit. Having completed post graduation in Information Technology from IIIT, why do you want to pursue Career in Business analytics? Questions in core engineering part- Merge sort or Quick sort and in what cases would they work better with examples, also explain their worst case complexities. Explain Dijkstra’s algorithm with an example. Questions in probability and statistics part-If I were to toss an unbiased coin 10 times, how many heads should I expect? If the coin is biased and the probability of head appearing is 1/3, then how many heads do I expect in 30 trials. Explain Taylor’s series and its uses. Where are complex numbers used in real life? SUGGESTIONS – Just brush up your knowledge on probability, Statistics and your engineering mathematics. Have a look at sorting and search algorithms. Also be prepared to answer why a career in Analytics. ————————————————————————– Shubhodeep Dey – B.Tech, Chemical Engineering, NITK, Surathkal, 2013; 33 months of experience in Petrochemicals, Reliance Industries Limited Duration: 20 mins I had done a lot of projects during my job so they started with what is the most innovative thing you have done. As soon as I started with my answer, they started asking me random questions on the assembly line (petrochemical industries don’t have anything related to assembly lines). I was able to answer some of them. Then they drew a curve on the sheet and asked me what is the covariance between the data points. I had a good idea about this concept so I could deliver. They moved on to probability and wanted me to visualise a binomial distribution for the number of defectives being produced by a lathe machine given a probability of finding a defective. I could satisfy them by writing down the equations. Some more probability questions followed on coin tosses. My interview ended with a concluding question – what are the major oil producing economies which are not a part of OPEC? All in all, it went fairly good, I got stuck on few of their questions but they were kind enough to guide me. You don’t have to know everything, what they are looking for is the approach to the problem. Confidence and clarity of thoughts are key factors. The written exam had a heavy contribution in the final selection. ————————————————————————– Parag Bhandarkar – B. Tech. in Electronics Engineering, VJTI Mumbai, 2014; 23 months of experience as a Software engineer, Diebold Duration: 20 mins Describe your work experience.

What is the reliability in Software domain? What factors affects it? Which affects more – Software / Hardware? and why? 2 basic mathematics questions-Based on definite Integrals of some box function, Integration of some trigonometric function SUGGESTIONS-I think admission committee looked for a balanced profile. It was also written on the website that they will look for Academic, test score and interview performance. As my academic performance was very good, despite “only-good” performance in test and interview, overall weight got balanced. ————————————————————————– Prem Krishn – B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering, IIT BHU, 2011; 54 months of experience in Tata Steel (Manufacturing industry) Duration: 25 mins Based on my design experience in 3D modelling of Electricals at Tata Steel, they asked about my work in detail, then they gave the equation of a solid geometry and asked what does it represent exactly, Based on a certification I had in Data Science and SAS from Jigsaw Academy, What is p-value? (Some questions to test that I really know it), What is the lacking point in R? (I told about memory issues.) They asked about my role model, some Current Affairs questions about him. They seem to focus majorly on my prior knowledge about Analytics, genuine interest in the course and balanced answers. ————————————————————————– Anshuman Roy – B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, 2011; 4 years of experience in TCS (IT industry) Duration: 15 mins Why do I want to go for analytics field after 4 years of work experience in IT? Which technologies and programming languages I worked on? General formula of permutation and combination with their meaning and explanation with example. Draw as many dots on a sheet of paper and asked how many triangles can be drawn in that many number of dots. How many lines joining 2 dots can be drawn in that many number of dots. Those days state elections preparations were going on in West Bengal. So I was asked 3 popular political parties of West Bengal, Delhi and Punjab, what are the major issues affecting people in these states, what was the issue going on among Kejriwal, Punjab and Haryana related to the water supply to Delhi. Questions related to programming as I had programming background. He wrote few numbers and asked me what will be the best algorithm to bring 6(a number which was in the middle of the series) to the second position. It was a question on sorting. They asked me to write down the algorithm. SUGGESTIONS – I guess they are judging your willingness and enthusiasm for this program. How much you can think to get to the answer. Sometimes they also look for your thought process instead of the right answer. ————————————————————————– Swapnika Vajrapu – B. Tech. in Chemical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, 2014; 2 years of experience in Analytics in Banking sector, Crosslink Analytics Duration: 25 mins Questions based on my project at workplace which was related to predictive analytics like- What were the dependent variables considered and what were the trends noticed? What was the mathematical equation used? Which tools were used? What algorithms were used? (Detailed description of the whole project) Some basic questions related to machine learning algos which I told I was aware of. Mainly linear regression. What does the SAS output of linear regression model indicate? What’s the difference between causality and correlation? 1 basic question related to geometry- if you move 5 km towards North, 5 km towards South-West and so on, finally where would you be as compared to the starting point? SUGGESTIONS – They don’t expect the final answer to be correct always, they see the thought process involved in solving a problem.

What are some probability distributions you know? Explain the Poisson and Normal distribution. A couple of questions on linear algebra were asked which included solving a system of equations. Discussion on the JNU row, wasn’t asked anything objective. I was asked about the HR policies at my workplace and which of these were liked/disliked by the employees. ————————————————————————– Sakshi Agarwal – B.Tech + M.Tech. in Biochemical Engineering & Biotechnology, IIT Delhi, 2014; 2 years of work experience in Analytics (CPG sector), Fractal Analytics Duration: 20 mins The interview started with a brief introduction about myself. Questions on work experience: What projects did you work on? Can you specify few important variables in the data you used in this project? How did you use these variables? What variables, you think, can affect sales of a company? Questions on Statistics and Maths: Do you know basic statistics? What is hypothesis testing? Type-I, II errors? Test statistic? significance level? How do you define risk and decision making? Given a signum function, discuss its limits and continuity, differentiability. Some basic puzzle In my opinion, they were mainly concerned about the confidence and clarity in the mathematical concepts and the reasoning ability of the candidate. ————————————————————————– Mukul Sonker – B.Tech. In Electrical engineering, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, 2016 Duration: 20-25 mins There were 3 questions from statistics: What is CDF? At a given point what will be the pdf? Can you derive standard deviation? They asked most of the questions from maths after knowing my interest in mathematics. The questions are (not necessarily in order): 1. What is the differentiation of X!? 2. One question from definite integral. 3. Differentiate log X by first derivative method. 4. Integration of log X ( I was also questioned for a particular method to find the solution). 5. Sketch the curve of log X+1 with steps. Few questions on current affairs: Currencies of different countries . About maps. US elections? They asked a few HR questions as well – why we should not select you? Why I am not going for a job? My final year project. ————————————————————————– Gunja Agarwal – B. Tech. in Computer Science, Jaypee university, 2015 Duration: 35 mins Tell me about yourself. Do you have other interview calls? A puzzle was given to solve – there are 3 bottles and a coin, so the probability of choosing a bottle is 1/3 but you have to get this probability by flipping a coin. What is the method to achieve the desired result? Answer: flip the coin twice and assign each bottle a unique id i.e TT, HT, TH, HH. But there are only 3 bottles, so create a dummy bottle and assign HH to it. Whenever while flipping a coin HH comes, you need to flip it again till a bottle is chosen. This way we can form an infinite GP series. Opinion on JNU event Questions on Computer science subjects like- what is deadlock and some famous problem which is yet not solved? Name the layers of networking in order? What is a graph and difference between a graph and a tree? I was asked to write the pointer program in C and was also asked to explain it in detail Feedback: In my case, I think my higher secondary school marks in mathematics and graduation marks help me to grab some brownie points. Also, I was able to crack the puzzle confidently that they asked in the beginning. ————————————————————————– Kaustubh Daware – B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering, COEP, 2015; 11 months of experience in FCA (Automobile industry) Duration: 20 mins I was asked about my work as testing and validation engineer in my company. They tried to relate statistics with my work. Panel had given me a riddle and I was asked to calculate the probability of the event specified in that riddle. I was also asked to solve a problem on limits. The interview panel asked me about my hobbies. When I told them that I like reading books, they questioned about my favourite books and what are they about. I was also asked that why am I pursuing PGDBA instead of masters in electrical as I had published few IEEE papers in my undergrad. FEEDBACK: According to me, a fair idea on probability and calculus would suffice in cracking the interview. ————————————————————————– Harsh Kumar – B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering, IIT Delhi, 2016 Duration: 15 mins What is linear regression? What is the complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm? What is BFS (Breadth first Search) and its complexity? Why do you want to be in this course? One particular thing that you like the most and why?

Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand.

The syllabus for a previous written test is mentioned here: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/instruction-syllabus We do not have an official set of study materials recommended for the test.

Madhur Modi It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds. Here’s a showcase of their profiles: Alok Mani Singh The civil engineer from BHEL, and the “stud” with 4-year worth of experience from a Maharatna PSU and IIT Guwahati attached in his name was the first person who secured his foreign intern in the prestigious Dunia Finance in Dubai. The “Perfect Statistician” as well as the “Management expert” who can solve any problem that comes his way “within a night or two”. He also likes to play guitar and has entertained us for past one and a half years with his pleasant voice. Now he will be working closely with the head of strategic analytics function at Dunia during his 6-month internship in Dubai. Siddhant Sanjeev “Coder” as everyone in the batch knows him to be, was the only other person to impress the company Dunia and accompany Alok to Dubai. Everyone in the batch knows him as a fresher with computer science background from NSIT and a national level coder. He also got himself an interview offer from Google owing to his coding skills as well as won case competitions from PwC and Deloitte. He also developed an e-commerce website using intricate concepts of natural language processing, recommendation systems and information retrieval. Ankitkumar Sonthalia Better known as “Sonthu”, this guy has 3 years of work experience from Cognizant and now he is going to work for Rocket Internet in Myanmar. He has worked on marketing strategy, predictions and recommendation systems. He is a travel enthusiast and has organized many unforgettable trips for our batch. He has also conducted cricket fantasy league and freshers’ party. Rachit Tripathi A mechanical engineer from IIT Kanpur by mind and a quant trader by heart, Rachit bagged an internship in France at QuantCube Technology, a niche fintech company. He’s also part of the team selected for data science game, an international inter-university competition held in Paris. In his pursuit of becoming a quant trader, he obtained CFA level 1 certification and solved various cases from those on Walmart to those on Yahoo data. He is also known as the “data scientist” of the batch and has recently been selected as one of the finalists in Goldman Sachs Quantify competition. Avinash Kumar He is a mechanical engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has worked in L&T for 3 years. He was offered an internship at Rocket Internet which he did not take as he aspired to work in India. He has written an international research paper and also has been part of the Data Science Game with Rachit during this course. He also won NASA systems engineering award while being a B.Tech. student. Besides, he is also a skilled TT player as well as a chess enthusiast. Bharathi Ramaraj Bharathi got the internship offer from Rocket Internet but she decided to stay in India. The only girl to get a foreign internship offer, she is a fresher with B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering. She has worked on uplift modeling, high-frequency data and news analytics and has taken part in various Kaggle competitions. She is also an international chess player and has traveled to as many as 16 countries representing India. She envisions being a financial analyst and to use advanced analytics techniques in a financial credit company to build her career. Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world. Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Maunish Shah December 22, 2015 Reply Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? pgdbaunofficial December 16, 2015 Reply There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. sarthak aggarwal December 29, 2015 Reply sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Mbs January 1, 2016 Reply What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 ankit gupta January 12, 2016 Reply can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material?

Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well.

December 18, 2015 pgdba_admin Campus Life 5 Comments Here comes our atta boy, our cheerful Madhur Modi to speak about our first semester at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. He is a CS grad, tinted with the experience of working in Acrobat Team, Adobe, India for 11 months. Let’s hear what Madhur says! After a not-so long orientation and pre-semester at IIM C, it was time to move to ISI. All of us were already feeling the attachment we had built with each other and formed the spirit of ‘joka tribe’ within ourselves. We started our journey to learn and started packing… but we were not done with the pre-semester yet! 🙂 Not before we can have a last photo-session! Even the journey to ISI was an insightful one! Filled with discussions of memories made within the short month. Happy faces! I remember us all at the peak of our enthusiasm when we visited ISI for the first time after the orientation, this time for around 6 months with knowledge imparted from renowned teachers. Since each of us had opted for the hostel facilities, the registration day was spent in lodging and document formalities. It all began with 5 subjects, 8 teachers and 51 students – daily two hour classes, twice daily where a moment of flickering attention meant you’ll lose the ability to grasp anything for the rest of the class. Yes! We had teachers who could teach us their subject continuously for two hours and every moment… each of them they made us wonder how amazing it is to learn in an enjoyable fashion. We all felt so comfortable moving from our 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional minds to nth dimensions and then move down using multidimensional scaling ☺ ☺ (was I too technical here? Come to ISI and you’ll know what I mean). I bet all our teachers from ISI would be laughing reading the joke here. By the ways, if you’re writing about ISI, it won’t be a just article if you do not mention each teacher separately! Starting from our class teacher and DBMS teacher prof. Pinakpani Pal, it was him who would come to our rescue each time, whether it is to change the mess, requirement of any additional facilities, aid in any procedures or help regarding the subject. He would kindly reach out his hand and solve all our problems in a flick. DBMS was also taught by prof. Amiya and prof. Dilip who would take care of SQL teaching for us. Thanks to him, DBMS was one of the most comfortable subjects in ISI. I still remember the fact that 44 teachers have bhattacharya awards in their name! We all used to marvel at the level of knowledge at ISI, rather, we felt grateful to our teachers for feeding such golden nuggets of information to us daily and Prof. Debasis is the teacher who’s teaching reminded us the reasons they won those awards. I always felt that he teaches one subject but I learned things anyone would consider is worth much more! From histograms, scatter plots, distributions and tests for distributions, he took us to bivariate and the multivariate analysis followed by more tests and feature selection. Moreover, he took extra classes and doubt sessions every week just to ensure that when we learn, we learn well When you start talking about the teachers, each teacher is better than the other! We had Statistical Probabilistic Analysis taught by two teachers, Prof. Bimal and Prof. Kishan. It was the only subject with no assignments, since probability has such a wide scope. This class was all practical, we were given real life examples and applied concepts to solve them. There was yet another similar subject, inference, taught by Prof. Amitava which encompassed all other subjects and drew inference tests from each of them, filled with more real life examples. We had one more course, or rather, set of course ☺ Computing in data science taught by Prof. Saurav Sengupta. I could proudly say to those non-cse students who fear how they would learn programming techniques- this is the course that will help you make your first transition. From practically negligible knowledge, this course taught us not just R and Python, but also made us do an entire team project to deep seat the lessons in our hearts. The best thing? We had fun! I would frequently visit the course website and our project blog and proudly say that we have come far, far from where we were when we entered ISI. P.S. do check out the blog of group 1 authored by our group. 🙂 Didn’t I mention anything else besides studies? How forgetful of me! ISI is a place of happenings! Every other day there were announcements of workshops in various fields of statistics and there were a variety of activities which would now be sweet memories for us with ISI. We flew kites, we had birthday parties, we played games and we had our first formal photoshoot! Looking smart! ISI also had a very special memory… Diwali! What’s that? How did we celebrate it? I could boast that it was better than any student had celebrated while at college! Two of our batchmates, Mr. Avinash (a.k.a. Gandhi) and Mukul cleaned their room and turned it into the Pooja venue (see photos in link) We made diyas, did Pooja, sang bhakti songs, distributed Prasad and made rangoli ! We burnt a few crackers and all our rooms illuminated with the auspiciousness on that day! It was one of the best Diwali celebrations of my life! Diwali! Soon after Durga puja, Diwali and Kali puja, we had our final exams and had to say “Bye Bye ISI” I am thankful that our first semester was conducted at ISI where we learnt such a great deal and progressed so far ahead in our skills. It already feels like we can do most of business analytics even though we have ways to go. How could be go away without saying a delightful adios to our Indian Statistical institute? We requested all the teachers to come for a final photoshoot session. Besides one photo present in CDS website , another photo from the last day would mark a fitting ending to our memories and knowledge lending roller coaster ride at the pillar of statistical, mathematical and machine learning institute!

Thanks in advance Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply There would be a separate application and test process for this year. Your Cat 2015 percentile won’t matter in this regard. I hope you have applied! ABHISHEK AGRAWAL January 19, 2016 Reply I have applied for the test. Could you please tell me what to expect in interview from your experience as i have around 2 months to prepare for it. Madhur Modi January 20, 2016 Reply At this point, do focus on the written test first. You should again be prepared with mathematics for the interview as well. Most of the other questions besides maths are similar to a typical IIM interview. You will need to prepare additional topics as well such as probability and differentiation. Based on your profile, some specific questions might be asked. Also, stay tuned for future posts on the blog where we may post further insights!

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

The classes were held initially at the Kolmogorov bhavan. Within a month we were given our own classroom in the Satyendra Nath Bose Bhavan. Kolmogorov bhavan, ISI Our curriculum consisted of 5 subjects. The subjects and the professors involved were: Statistical inference – Amitava Banerjee Stochastic processes – Dr. Bimal Roy & Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta Computing for data sciences – Dr. Sourav Sengupta Statistical structures in data – Debashish Sengupta Database Management Systems – Dr. Pinakpani Pal & Amiya Das By far the stars of the course were the faculty members. It was an honour to interact with a Padma Shree awardee in Dr. Bimal Roy. To be taught on a regular basis by such an esteemed personality was slightly overwhelming and hugely enriching. The sheer brilliance of the man and his way of looking at probability and its applications was an experience difficult to pen down. Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta shared the course and taught Markov Chains. Satyendra Nath bhavan , ISI Campus Diligent and sincere, Prof. Debashish Sengupta was the ideal teacher. He covered every topic rigorously starting right with the basics of statistics to the highly complex multivariate analysis. What seemed an easy course initially, became heavily loaded and among the toughest by the time the course came to its completion. Tutorials were held every week to discuss exercise problems. The jovial Prof. Amitava Banerjee taught us the habit of drawing meaningful inferences out of large volumes of data. Drawing from his vast pool of consultancy experience, he inculcated in us the ability to convert real life business problems into statistical problems. His assignments involved working on datasets and testing hypothesis in the correct way. Dr. Pinakpani Pal was interactive, and worked hard to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. His course had 2 parts: the theoretical knowledge of databases, and a hands-on SQL application. He shared the course with Amiya Das, a seasoned professional at Oracle. The friendly and ever enthusiastic Dr Sourav Sengupta was always approachable and motivated the entire batch in getting accustomed with highly complex ideas. His passion for teaching shone through as he went through the concepts of linear algebra and machine learning algorithms. He organised the course superbly and the web page for his course was among the best resource repositories we could have hoped for. The invited lectures were top drawer, with experienced professionals coming in to share their insights and recommendations about the field of analytics. Overall the first semester was a learning experience beyond compare and laid a solid foundation on which we can build in our journey towards becoming well-rounded data scientists.

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course.

So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

Madhur Modi It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds. Here’s a showcase of their profiles: Alok Mani Singh The civil engineer from BHEL, and the “stud” with 4-year worth of experience from a Maharatna PSU and IIT Guwahati attached in his name was the first person who secured his foreign intern in the prestigious Dunia Finance in Dubai. The “Perfect Statistician” as well as the “Management expert” who can solve any problem that comes his way “within a night or two”. He also likes to play guitar and has entertained us for past one and a half years with his pleasant voice. Now he will be working closely with the head of strategic analytics function at Dunia during his 6-month internship in Dubai. Siddhant Sanjeev “Coder” as everyone in the batch knows him to be, was the only other person to impress the company Dunia and accompany Alok to Dubai. Everyone in the batch knows him as a fresher with computer science background from NSIT and a national level coder. He also got himself an interview offer from Google owing to his coding skills as well as won case competitions from PwC and Deloitte. He also developed an e-commerce website using intricate concepts of natural language processing, recommendation systems and information retrieval. Ankitkumar Sonthalia Better known as “Sonthu”, this guy has 3 years of work experience from Cognizant and now he is going to work for Rocket Internet in Myanmar. He has worked on marketing strategy, predictions and recommendation systems. He is a travel enthusiast and has organized many unforgettable trips for our batch. He has also conducted cricket fantasy league and freshers’ party. Rachit Tripathi A mechanical engineer from IIT Kanpur by mind and a quant trader by heart, Rachit bagged an internship in France at QuantCube Technology, a niche fintech company. He’s also part of the team selected for data science game, an international inter-university competition held in Paris. In his pursuit of becoming a quant trader, he obtained CFA level 1 certification and solved various cases from those on Walmart to those on Yahoo data. He is also known as the “data scientist” of the batch and has recently been selected as one of the finalists in Goldman Sachs Quantify competition. Avinash Kumar He is a mechanical engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has worked in L&T for 3 years. He was offered an internship at Rocket Internet which he did not take as he aspired to work in India. He has written an international research paper and also has been part of the Data Science Game with Rachit during this course. He also won NASA systems engineering award while being a B.Tech. student. Besides, he is also a skilled TT player as well as a chess enthusiast. Bharathi Ramaraj Bharathi got the internship offer from Rocket Internet but she decided to stay in India. The only girl to get a foreign internship offer, she is a fresher with B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering. She has worked on uplift modeling, high-frequency data and news analytics and has taken part in various Kaggle competitions. She is also an international chess player and has traveled to as many as 16 countries representing India. She envisions being a financial analyst and to use advanced analytics techniques in a financial credit company to build her career. Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world. Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics.

When you tell them that you’ve made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, “What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. -The Little Prince Our first exams in this first semester at ISI have finally arrived. One of the subjects of the course, and of the more interesting ones I might add, is ‘Probability and Stochastic Processes’. This was also the subject of our first exam. I have been pouring over notes and hundreds of pages of text in preparation of this exam. The intricacies in some of the ideas reminded me of these lines taken from ‘The Little Prince’ and quoted by David Freedman in his book on Statistics. Are such matters as figures and charts always dry and boring? In our first class, the professor of the same subject also remarked, “Maybe our insistence on numbers is the limitation of man”. ‘The Little Prince’ is a famous classic written by Saint Antoine du Exupery. Although it was first written as a children’s book, it has been enjoyed over the years by adults alike as a heart-warming story on friendship, growing-up and the curious fascinations of man. One of the oft used coinages in the book is the phrase ‘matters of consequence’. The Little Prince finds, at one point, a man aimlessly counting stars to the extent that he reaches ‘five hundred and one million’. This man then ironically refers to his counting as a matter of consequence. In these days leading up to our exams, I began to wonder whether factuality could be made interesting in the context of some intricacies I came across in problems of Probability Theory. Are there questions that I can ask that are not as dry as the character’s occupation of counting in The Little Prince? Consider the following questions. How many random people would I need to collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that at least two of them share their birthdays? The answer to this is a surprisingly low number. Let’s look at a different question. How many people would I need to catch hold of and ask birthdays of to have half a chance of finding someone who shares my birthday? It is also interesting to note that this number is different from the first one. Louis CK, the famous stand-up comedian, made an interesting remark in one of his live shows. He said that there were enough people attending his show for there to be a fair chance that a few of them would die in the coming year. Ouch! Let’s pose that as a question on chance. Assume a population with a certain death rate. What is the number of people I would have to randomly collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that someone would die tomorrow? Enough with birthdays and death days. Consider coin tosses. Say, I keep tossing a coin and keep getting heads for a hundred tosses. I only know that it is equally likely that my coin is anything between a perfectly rigged coin to a perfectly fair coin. What is the chance that I win if I bet on the next toss to be heads? Let’s stretch this slightly further. Let us assume that when the universe was born, the probability that the sun would rise over planet earth each day was made to depend on a coin toss. We only know that this coin was likely to be anything between a perfectly fair to a perfectly unfair coin (God is playing a cruel game). What is the probability that the sun would rise tomorrow, given that it has been rising each day over all these years since the birth of the universe? Let’s give some rest to our poor coin and move on to other questions. The Monty Hall Problem is a famous example on how sometimes the idea of chance can stump intuition. Here’s a different example in a similar vein. Suppose there are three suspects in jail who have been cleared of any wrongdoing and are all going to be released soon. It is announced that two of the three would be released the next day but these three don’t know exactly which two of them will be released. One of them decides to go ask the guard which one of the other two prisoners is going to be released. But then he thinks the following to himself, “After I have asked, I have only a one in two chance that I’m the second guy to be released. But before I ask, there is a two in three chance that I will be one of the guys to be released. So should I rather not ask?” Like one of our professors quips so often, ‘Remember that there’s a chance model somewhere in the background.’ Somebody somewhere is flipping a coin. Maybe someday a story will be written on a travelling mathematician who visits magical planets to ask questions on chances of consequence. It’s a long shot that it would be anything as beautiful as the masterpiece that is the ‘The Little Prince’. But I wager it wouldn’t be as bad as dry pointless counting. Categories Articles Experiences Technical Joka Library to Paris – A Data Science Crusade Post author By pgdba_admin Post date September 7, 2016 No Comments on Joka Library to Paris – A Data Science Crusade A peek into Team Tabs, one of the three teams representing India at DSG. It was a crisp Friday morning and I was seated comfortably in the plush IIMC library. The PGDBA semester was well underway, assignments were raining thick and fast…life was busy…life was good and I was brimming with excitement. I had only just begun working on a competition, which had started 4 days ago on June 14th 2016. It was an inter-university data-science competition called the Data Science Game . With so many constraints such as limited number of submissions in a day and final selection of only one team from a college, it was, by all means the “big deal” and a glance at the list of competing universities showed us some tough nuts. There were the usual suspects i.e. Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford et al., supplemented by a host of premier universities from across the world. Certainly our team of four from first-ever batch of PGDBA, though no novices, were far from being among the best in the world… or were they? And so we – Team Tabs – prepared a starting output, clicked on the ‘Make Submission’ button and waited with a muted yet expectation-laced anxiety that any Kaggler worth his salt would be familiar with and then this image popped up on our screen: Most authors describe moments like these with the cliche ‘There was a moment of silence followed by….’ I discovered that they were quite wrong…as my uncontrollable Hagrid-like laughter filled the breadth of the IIM Calcutta library, defiant of the several bemused yet stern glares that were pointed in my direction! Second in the whole world! Irrespective of its ephemerality, irrespective of the pains required to maintain it or the challenges that we were about to face in the coming three weeks – it was a moment of reckoning for us, a moment to cherish, a moment to savour. Yet, when I look back I can say with certainty that it was at this point I started believing that international glory wasn’t beyond our reach. What followed were some of the most gruelling days of my life. Over the next three weeks, we went on to learn and implement Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithms for image classification. We travelled to multiple universities in a quest for servers to run these algorithms. We learnt, we toiled, we toiled hard and we thrived. When the competition ended, we were the top team from India – Yes! Our hard work and perseverance led to us being the Rank 1 Indian team . We were among the 20 teams from around the world selected to travel to Paris for the final phase of the competition and folks, as you read this article, we’re on the flight journey towards the finals of the competition in Paris, to be held on 9th September. What fills me with even more delight is that not just us, but three teams from India have made it to the final 20 – one each from IIM Calcutta-Team Tabs, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata- The Frequentists (in their ranking order). India has made its presence felt in this 2nd edition of Data Science Game and interestingly enough, all the three institutes are what together constitute PGDBA! It is encouraging to see that three Indian teams have proved themselves worthy of being the global top 20 when 146 teams from 28 countries participated and showed their mettle in this grueling competition. The competition contained an image classification problem. A set of images were given, which had to be classified into four categories. The problem at hand could have been done in various ways. We decided to use deep learning as a lot of interesting work is being done around it and it’s one of the most advanced techniques currently available. We had a basic knowledge about it and developed more understanding as we moved along. The process of compiling and executing codes went on and we worked hard every single day. The machine learning algorithms take time to execute and with limited computing power at our disposal and time constraint of the competition, we ensured that every iota of it was used. As we were fighting neck to neck with all top notch universities across the world, the task was not at all easy and there were a lot of hurdles on the way. The limited computing power slowed us down. Every iteration of the code required a whole day and thus constrained our capacity to experiment with the algorithm. Soon other teams caught up with us on the leaderboard. To wrinkle out the problems we went to IIT-KGP and ISI to gain server access. However, the terminals at both places were preoccupied. As a last resort, we decided to use Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was difficult to set-up because of the complex technicalities and as none of us was acquainted with the process, it made our job all the more difficult. We quickly took charge and read about it from the scratch, spending a precious time of 3 days to figure everything out and get it running. In hindsight, it was worth the effort. Our first run in AWS increased the accuracy by 5 % and it all paid off with the jump on the leaderboard. Now that we look at it, a lot of edge was given to us by our PGDBA curriculum. The basics of machine learning and computing were well laid out throughout the course. It enabled us to deep dive into deep learning and comprehend the technical aspects around it. We also consulted with professors for guidance. With Team Tabs standing at 12 in global rankings, we realize that we have learnt a lot on the way, when we were actually working on the problem statement. We will now be competing with some of the top Kagglers in the finals. The finale would certainly provide us with global exposure as we will get a macroscopic view of what’s happening around the world in the field of data science by interacting with top-notch data analysts spread across the world. Since it’s a 2-day competition, the dynamics of the game is bound to change. We haven’t been able to put in continuous concentrated efforts towards the final round owing to the rigorous academic curriculum this semester and us coping up on classes. We do have a lot to cover but we will keep learning new stuff as we have been doing in the past year. Thus a great opportunity for knowledge transfer and networking lies ahead. With everyone’s hopes in us, we make our journey to Paris, where the final leg of the competition awaits… along with our fateful turnout in the 2nd Data Science Game competition.

Team Tabs Do check out the team from ISI at the link: The Frequentists The Frequentists Categories Articles Experiences General The Journey of Identities Post author By pgdba_admin Post date August 14, 2016 No Comments on The Journey of Identities To all those who just joined in. And to all those who couldn’t. I’ve jumped ships. I’ve made the leap. I am now a part of what they call Tata Hall- the luxurious guesthouse at IIM C, when I used to be a part of what they called Himadri (my IIT Delhi hostel). I am convinced that recording my first impressions of this maddening, surreal odyssey that I have set out on will not only prove to be fruitful in retrospect, but in fact help me in retaining my sanity in the present. For those of you who have been wondering what I’m going to blabber about, I would like to give you some context before you abandon me. I am now a student at the PGDBA program. I am comfortably living in my posh suite of the guesthouse of IIM C, with my amazing roommate, situated in Joka, which is nearly thirty kilometers away from the city of Kolkata. There are one hundred and three other students in this program who live with me, so I am sometimes tempted to forget that we are literally in the middle of nowhere. We are being fed an illusion – but an irresistible one that I don’t have the heart to snap out of. In some ways, the fact that the city is beyond my reach is liberating. The five years I spent living in the heart of Delhi, and then another two years in the legendary city of Mumbai, I craved for an escape, for a way out. I think this program has finally answered my call for help. Here, I am constantly told that I am special, that I am the chosen one. The twenty-four years of my life that have led to this moment have made me so cynical that I doubt their belief in me. But at the same time, I greatly value it. After a very long time, I am around people who are willing to invest in my future simply because the three accomplished panel members saw a spark in me, during the twenty-five minutes I spent interviewing for the program. I feel humbled and terrified. The two years ahead are going to demand every inch of me, it is going to consume me, and it is going to change me. But for so long I have felt nothing, that this rush, this constant buzz in my head, this restlessness feels good. I am sleep-deprived, surviving on n number of cups of terribly made tea and coffee and hopping from one assignment to the other with some extended breaks thankfully, and yet, I am alive. How often is it that you are so committed to the moment that every other structure inside and outside your mind breaks form, and this particular moment is all that you can see, all that you can register? This program is one such moment in my life. The program, which aims at producing a team of unparalleled business analysts and data scientists, supposedly the sexiest job in the market these days, has been ideated by the three premiere institutes of India – Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This very credibility generates the “Pygmalion effect” and drives me to excel in the area of analytics. The coming two years make me realize, that I’m far away from the comfort zone and stability that life had offered just before I decided to enroll into PGDBA. But I am also glad that it happened, for I can now appreciate the morning for what it truly represents – a fresh start. I like the concept of this new beginning, for it brings with it the exciting journey of exploring new dimensions and reconstruct your identity. I am tempted to fantasize about the future, but I am trying to contain my excitement to the moment. So many paths seem to call out to me that my brain will explode if I start to think too much. What do I want, you ask? Organized chaos. If you think that is romantically abstract, then you have understood me just a little more than you did before you began to read this note. I will end with a few lines that so perfectly describe my state of mind right now, that I might just marry Robert Frost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. Categories Experiences The ISI Chapter Post author By pgdba_admin Post date January 15, 2016 1 Comment on The ISI Chapter The first semester started on July 20, 2015. The classes were held initially at the Kolmogorov bhavan. Within a month we were given our own classroom in the Satyendra Nath Bose Bhavan. Kolmogorov bhavan, ISI Our curriculum consisted of 5 subjects. The subjects and the professors involved were: Statistical inference – Amitava Banerjee Stochastic processes – Dr. Bimal Roy & Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta Computing for data sciences – Dr. Sourav Sengupta Statistical structures in data – Debashish Sengupta Database Management Systems – Dr. Pinakpani Pal & Amiya Das By far the stars of the course were the faculty members. It was an honour to interact with a Padma Shree awardee in Dr. Bimal Roy. To be taught on a regular basis by such an esteemed personality was slightly overwhelming and hugely enriching. The sheer brilliance of the man and his way of looking at probability and its applications was an experience difficult to pen down. Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta shared the course and taught Markov Chains. Satyendra Nath bhavan , ISI Campus Diligent and sincere, Prof. Debashish Sengupta was the ideal teacher. He covered every topic rigorously starting right with the basics of statistics to the highly complex multivariate analysis. What seemed an easy course initially, became heavily loaded and among the toughest by the time the course came to its completion. Tutorials were held every week to discuss exercise problems. The jovial Prof. Amitava Banerjee taught us the habit of drawing meaningful inferences out of large volumes of data. Drawing from his vast pool of consultancy experience, he inculcated in us the ability to convert real life business problems into statistical problems. His assignments involved working on datasets and testing hypothesis in the correct way. Dr. Pinakpani Pal was interactive, and worked hard to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. His course had 2 parts: the theoretical knowledge of databases, and a hands-on SQL application. He shared the course with Amiya Das, a seasoned professional at Oracle. The friendly and ever enthusiastic Dr Sourav Sengupta was always approachable and motivated the entire batch in getting accustomed with highly complex ideas. His passion for teaching shone through as he went through the concepts of linear algebra and machine learning algorithms. He organised the course superbly and the web page for his course was among the best resource repositories we could have hoped for. The invited lectures were top drawer, with experienced professionals coming in to share their insights and recommendations about the field of analytics. Overall the first semester was a learning experience beyond compare and laid a solid foundation on which we can build in our journey towards becoming well-rounded data scientists.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date August 27, 2016 No Comments on The Best Laid Schemes, of Spiders and Men! What do entropy, linear programming and Riemann surfaces have in common? Puzzled? Now imagine this connection explained by an eccentric speaker in the attire of a French stage magician, with the charm and virtuosity of a storyteller. Cedric Villani, French mathematician, Fields Medal awardee in the year 2010 and famously called by the NewYorker magazine as the ‘Lady Gaga of Mathematics’ delivered a public lecture titled ‘Of Triangles, Gases, Prices and Men’ at ISI on 26 th August 2016. The second PGDBA batch, currently in its first semester here at ISI, had the opportunity to be present at this intriguing and informative session. Cedric Villani The abstraction and intrigue of Cedric could be assumed from the fact that an introduction to him included a reference to the number of his pets. This abstraction could also be inferred from the title of his talk, which was a play on the title of John Steinbeck’s famous classic ‘Of Mice and Men.’ The first slide of his presentation was taken from Tennyson’s Lady of Shalott. In Cedric’s own interpretation, the Lady of Shalott, accursed to see the world only through a mirror, was actually an allegory to the mathematician forever accursed to look at reality through his equations! Cedric then said that there are many more unsolved mysteries in Mathematics today than there were a hundred years ago. There are ever so many new problems that keep arising. Then there are those age-old ones that lie in famous mathematicians’ lists of unsolved problems. One such famous unproved hypothesis is the Riemann hypothesis. This led Cedric down the path to explaining Riemann’s works and then to the first part of the evening’s presentation – ‘triangles’. He introduced to the audience Riemann surfaces and how Escher employed curved surfaces in his art. As examples of negative curvatures, he showed images of art installations in museums and models of coral reef. Einstein, with the help of his mathematician colleagues, used Riemann’s ideas to develop his General Theory of Relativity. Cedric went on to add that, the GPS technology so ubiquitous in the world today has its roots in Riemann’s works in topology. In a humorous turn of speech, Cedric noted that Riemann was as oblivious to his work being of practical use in 21 st century devices, as modern day GPS users were to Riemann’s surfaces. An ironic symmetry indeed! At this turn of his presentation, Cedric spoke about how it is equally important for scientists to pursue inspiration and not just utility. He marked out Riemann as someone who was particularly interested in approaching problems in his own unique way. Cedric quoted Poincare who had once said, “Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.” The second part of his talk on ‘gases’ started with a description of his visit to Vienna and a search for Boltzmann’s grave. He said that he stopped to ask a family for a map not expecting them to know Boltzmann, let alone his grave. To his surprise, he was not only directed to the location of the grave but the person also exclaimed Boltzmann’s equation of entropy, “S=klogW”! In connection with entropy, he then talked about the Gaussian curve, its ubiquitous nature and its uncanny appearance in many natural systems. He called the study of Probability and Statistics as ‘the extraordinary adventure of mastering of chance.’ As a matter of coincidence, he discussed a famous problem in his presentation called ‘Buffon’s needle’, which was also discussed in class earlier on the same day with the PGDBA students by their lecturer. Experiments such as coin tosses, Cedric said, are best done in the most careless ways! Then he explained how gases are modeled as billiard balls in collision and when there are many such sufficiently small billiard balls, their velocities are accurately modeled as the Gaussian distribution. As a note, Cedric remarked on the power of this distribution by quoting Sir Francis Galton who once called it the ‘supreme law of unreason.’ The next part of his presentation was ‘prices’. Cedric introduced Leonid Kantorovic, the father of linear programming. He explained how math is used to model the optimal allocation of resources. He then strung together ideas from the optimized distribution of resources to the distribution of gas molecules with the least loss of energy. The analogy of prices in linear programming is energy in distribution of gas molecules. This is where Cedric began piecing everything together with the last part of his talk called ‘men’. Cedric described how he had happened to meet his collaborators John Lott and Felix Otto. These men put together the ‘triangles’, ‘gases’ and ‘prices’ and helped Cedric complete his research on how fast gases reach the equilibrium stage described in Boltzmann’s equation. Cedric was awarded the Fields medal in connection with this research. What would have been an intimidating subject matter coming from volumes over volumes of text, was aptly introduced in a two-hour lecture by Cedric Villani, a master at his trade, a storyteller par excellence, a dinosaur catcher in his childhood dreams and a true ambassador of modern mathematics. In a surprising irony of sorts, apart from the many hidden mysteries in the details of his works, the most apparent mystery is the brooches of spiders that he wears on the lapels of his coat! ← The Journey of Identities → Joka Library to Paris – A Data Science Crusade Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Himanshu Goyal About the author: B. Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering from IIT Delhi – worked in Global Analytics (short-term loan provider in UK) for 5 years within collection analytics and risk analytics teams. There have been a lot of posts around the vision and scope of the program so I am not going to touch upon that for now. Instead, I am going to share my first-hand experience of the events in the first week – the orientation week – and how they affected my perception. Whenever we meet a stranger, we need an icebreaker to get things started. And that was the way the orientation week was designed. If there is one thing that repeatedly gets focussed on here at IIM-C, it is that you need to build your network. I had a fair deal of interactions with various groups. There were sessions with Deans, Program Founders, Professors, Seniors and last but not the least, multiple industry leaders. The sessions were designed to make the students more aware of the program, in terms of what the students should expect from it as well as what the professors and industries expected from its graduates. Not only did these sessions made me more informed, but I also learnt a few concepts in this week itself before the classes had even started! Interaction with Professors : There were multiple types of interactions with professors. In one of them, Deans and Senior Professors of the three institutes talked about the genesis of the program and how the geography of the three institutes fitted in perfectly to start it. It was heart-warming to see how each of them would compliment each other’s institution when their own was one of the best in its field. In another session, professors of the Organisational Behaviour course conducted a class exercise – Lost@C. While I won’t go into what it was, it would suffice to say that it was not only fun, but it also made me think on how to work better as a team. A session on how to solve case studies was organised as well. It was a very interactive session and I was encouraged to think and ask questions. All said and done, that my next 2 years were in the hands of capable professors. Interaction with Seniors : This was something each one of my batch was looking forward to. All of us had come from different backgrounds and we had questions – a significant number of them. The interaction started with introductions from both the batches. It then shifted to academic structure, the life at different campuses and the opportunities in the industry. There were a bunch of fundas from their end out of which I don’t remember much; but the key takeaway for me was that there is a huge demand in the industry for people having the right blend of technical skills and business acumen and this course perfectly bridges that gap. A large number of people have their eyes on how first few batches are performing and hence it will be up to us on how much we can push ourselves because the opportunity to gain knowledge in the three institutes is endless. Interaction with Industries : Companies were indeed looking forward to interact which was evident in the first week itself. Among them were – LatentView, PWC, KPMG, Deloitte and few others. What was striking to see was that despite belonging to diverse backgrounds, all of them had same expectations – the graduates from this course will be able to solve crucial business problems using data which will be analysed through various machine learning processes. Each of the companies highlighted the need for data scientists in today’s world because of the amount of data being generated and how it can be filled with us if we have the right mindset. It was also heartening to know that machine learning was now being applied to almost every domain (even agriculture); one just has to have an inquisitive mind to ask the right questions. I clearly remember a quote from one of such sessions, “Size of data is not the thing, but what you do with it.” Orientation day @ISI: As part of the orientation program, we also spent one day at ISI Kolkata and interacted with the professors there. At first look, ISI is an unassuming college (specially after going from IIM which has 7 lakes inside its campus!!). However, it is second to none when it comes to the faculty. One can easily find that each of the faculty is a gem by going through their profile and I cannot possible complete this article without mentioning Prof. Bimal Roy – A Padma Shri awardee, Master Cryptologist, Ex-Director at ISI – it can go on and on. He took a brief session and shared his personal experiences related to analytics. His way of telling stories really connected with me. He added a new dimension of problem solving techniques in my mind in that short session itself. . I already knew that ISI was going to play a unique role in this program because of its unparalleled specialisation in statistics and the one day spent there made me even more excited to start my studies. Given that the program is in its development stage, I had made a conscious choice and took a leap of faith while deciding to join the course. I had belief in the system, but was still apprehensive about industry expectations, and how will the institutes coordinate among themselves. These interactions, in one way or another, not only helped in soothing down my nerves but also made me even more excited and motivated to do well and make this program a success. As Abraham Lincoln once said, The best way to predict your future is to create it .

The procedure to apply for admission to the PGDBA batch of 2021-2023 will be available here: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/how-apply We strongly recommend you to go through the admission policy here before applying: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/programs/pgdba/admissions/admission-policy-2021-23-batch 2) What are the topics that are expected to covered in the written test? How do I prepare for the test? Is the test of JEE/CAT/XAT level? The syllabus for a previous written test is mentioned here: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/instruction-syllabus We do not have an official set of study materials recommended for the test. However, you can look through the sample paper here: https://www.isical.ac.in/~pgdba/Documents/SampleQuestion2020.pdf , to assess the difficulty level of the test. The actual paper would be fairly close to this set of questions. The set of topics and the sample paper together should help you prepare for the test. Further, they would help you assess the level of the test, in comparison to other tests. 3) What kind of questions can I expect in the interview? The interview mostly revolves around your basic understanding of statistics, probability and a few other relevant mathematical concepts, your work experience and your motivation to join the program. There may also be questions on other aspects of your profile, some latest events and so on. Here are a few interview experiences of the students from 2020-2022 batch that should give you a fair idea of what to expect: https://aspirants.pgdba.ml/2021/04/03/pgdba-interview-experiences-2020-22/ 4) Is my profile good enough to make it to the program? As long as you fulfill the basic eligibility criteria, your final selection comes down to your profile (including your academics and your work experience), your score in the written test and in the interview, and additionally, the pool of candidates applying with you, given the limited number of seats. 5) What are the expected cut-offs for various categories (General, SC/ST, NC-OBC) for the written test? The institutes do not disclose this information.

The classes were held initially at the Kolmogorov bhavan. Within a month we were given our own classroom in the Satyendra Nath Bose Bhavan. Kolmogorov bhavan, ISI Our curriculum consisted of 5 subjects. The subjects and the professors involved were: Statistical inference – Amitava Banerjee Stochastic processes – Dr. Bimal Roy & Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta Computing for data sciences – Dr. Sourav Sengupta Statistical structures in data – Debashish Sengupta Database Management Systems – Dr. Pinakpani Pal & Amiya Das By far the stars of the course were the faculty members. It was an honour to interact with a Padma Shree awardee in Dr. Bimal Roy. To be taught on a regular basis by such an esteemed personality was slightly overwhelming and hugely enriching. The sheer brilliance of the man and his way of looking at probability and its applications was an experience difficult to pen down. Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta shared the course and taught Markov Chains. Satyendra Nath bhavan , ISI Campus Diligent and sincere, Prof. Debashish Sengupta was the ideal teacher. He covered every topic rigorously starting right with the basics of statistics to the highly complex multivariate analysis. What seemed an easy course initially, became heavily loaded and among the toughest by the time the course came to its completion. Tutorials were held every week to discuss exercise problems. The jovial Prof. Amitava Banerjee taught us the habit of drawing meaningful inferences out of large volumes of data. Drawing from his vast pool of consultancy experience, he inculcated in us the ability to convert real life business problems into statistical problems. His assignments involved working on datasets and testing hypothesis in the correct way. Dr. Pinakpani Pal was interactive, and worked hard to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. His course had 2 parts: the theoretical knowledge of databases, and a hands-on SQL application. He shared the course with Amiya Das, a seasoned professional at Oracle. The friendly and ever enthusiastic Dr Sourav Sengupta was always approachable and motivated the entire batch in getting accustomed with highly complex ideas. His passion for teaching shone through as he went through the concepts of linear algebra and machine learning algorithms. He organised the course superbly and the web page for his course was among the best resource repositories we could have hoped for. The invited lectures were top drawer, with experienced professionals coming in to share their insights and recommendations about the field of analytics. Overall the first semester was a learning experience beyond compare and laid a solid foundation on which we can build in our journey towards becoming well-rounded data scientists.

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Reply Venkatesh says: January 16, 2016 at 9:17 am Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:36 am For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well. Reply Hardik Agarwal says: March 27, 2016 at 12:44 pm URGENT : If I don’t have an important document that has to be shown during the interview process in original (as said in the call letter), can I show its copy and give an undertaking of that? Will it work or will they cancel my candidature? Thanks in advance. Reply Madhur Modi says: April 20, 2016 at 10:04 am The interviews are already over. I think you would have already received the instructions from the panel about this Reply subhodeep says: April 19, 2016 at 10:28 am hi, i converted my PGDBA call. i am looking forward to join this course and very optimistic about it. just need to convince myself that avg salary will be equivalent to PGDM of IIMC. how is the industry perceiving this course. are companies like BCG and MCG lined up for PGDBA?

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

The aim is to provide a general idea about the profile of the students and their respective interview experiences to help aspirants prepare better for the big day. PS – The interview panel consisted of three members. Bharathi Ramaraj – B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering; International Chess Player “I introduced myself as a chess player. And the first thing that followed was why I wanted to pursue Analytics, being a chess player. I said, I wanted to make an impact, also decision making plays a big role in analytics thus being a chess player gives me the apt mindset in the field. I gave real-life examples where I used chess playing skills and also highlighted my enthusiasm towards chess by describing how I view situations as a chessboard and how I involve members as pieces playing the game. The panelists gave me new situations to test my viewpoint by letting me turn the interview into a game of chess where the panelists and I were pieces on the board. I took up the problem and described various strategies that I had at my disposal. I spoke at length about the best strategy that I would deploy to win the game. They also asked about the factors which led me to pursue analytics like my placement in an analytics company and why I wanted to complete postgraduate studies. To this I replied, doing it now would help me save time and gain an early advantage which will be very valuable in the long run. My interview was relatively short compared to other candidates.” ****** Shashank Kumar -B.Tech in EEE , 2.5+ years of experience in VLSI design “I was the first person to be interviewed at my center. The conversation started with current affairs and the morning news. The analytics projects during my engineering were heavily focused upon. Technical questions included topics like probability, regression, various types of regression and analysis of the quality of fit based on residual plots. The interview spanned around 15 minutes. In hindsight, I think it was a pretty short interview” ****** Sajal Jain – Class representative (PGDBA 2015-2017),B.Tech in Civil Engineering with 4 years of experience in software industry “My interview wasn’t strictly a technical one. The few questions included questions on differentiability and continuity and other basic mathematical concepts. My interview majorly focused on how, in my view, my background of civil engineer with more than 4 years of experience in software industry would indulge in a career in analytics and add a different value and perspectives to the batch. The questions were not at all tough so I would advise the candidates to be firm in their basics” ****** Ayan Sengupta , a fresher who has done BSc and MSc in mathematics and computing “Having a background different from most of the other candidates, my interview was naturally quite unique in its own way. I expected a tough line of questioning from the panelists but my interview consisted of aptitude questions such as how I would find a method for the CEO of the company I work in to cross a river given that he doesn’t know swimming. There were also other puzzles such as – Why manholes are round and simple mathematical questions covering number theory . The interview was around 20-25 minutes long.” ****** Shoorvir Gupta , a fresher in mechanical engineering and an IES aspirant “My interview started with the description of my college and grades. I mentioned my college life and how I became inclined towards gaming, had all A’s in technical subjects, very high CAT score and a 10 pointer in internship. The rest of the interview was focused on IES and related questions to various fields in IES, questions on strength of material and on boilers and its parts (mechanical subjects). Technical questions were mostly around probability and statistics and its applications. Towards the end of the interview they also asked about my background and hometown related questions.” ****** Ritwik Prashant , a fresher with B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and amongst the most meticulous students within the batch “I started with my introduction and how I was in touch with analytics (Coursera courses). I also described my interests in fantasy football where one has to apply optimizations and statistics in decision making. Technical questions were based around matrices where they made a deep dive until they touched unfamiliar topics. Being a fresher from IIT Madras, they also questioned me about my college placement and my orientation towards this course rather than taking up a job. Thus my entire interview was based on the initial steer I had provided with my introduction.” ****** Pranita Khandelwal , a fresher with dual degree (EEE and Economics) “The interview started off with the recurring question about my degrees- how I ended up studying both Economics and EEE. Later, I was tested on my knowledge of econometrics, and the panel asked some conceptual questions on linear regression and decision making using hypothesis testing. This was followed by questions related to my projects and internships .” ****** Avinash Kumar, a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience “I steered my interview with my introduction towards my college project at USA and my job profile description. The questions covered as to how I could apply data analytics to these projects and how other projects such as six sigma projects are related to analytics. Among technical questions, most of them were based on geometry and also tested my creativity and open mindedness. I had applied through GATE and was oriented towards aerodynamics so I mentioned why I wanted to pursue an analytics career and implement analytics in aerodynamics sector. I highlighted my orientation with awards (NASA system engineering award-1st prize) and description of college project. Even though most of the other candidates had 15 minute interviews that day, mine was a lengthy 35 minute one.” ****** Mukul Kumar , a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience and with same background as Avinash Kumar “Just like Avinash, I steered my interview with my introduction towards why I wanted to pursue analytics. I mentioned how I had researched and gained opinion about analytics from my peers and seniors and felt that the course aligns with my interests in mathematics and thus I can do justice to the course. Technical questions included mathematical ones (hyperbolic functions and their graphs, differentiation,1st differentiation principle and limit) but none on mechanical engineering. I had also applied through GATE and was asked the interview calls I had received. There were also questions based on puzzles and a few questions from written test which we had given during the pre-interview process.” ****** Sujan Biswas – BSc and MSc in chemistry, 2.75 years of experience in Banking and financial services “My panelists began with questions about my background and current job profile and drifted over to mathematical questions covering even and odd functions and matrices. Other questions included optimization based questions and decision making problems such as the methods and parameters one would use to determine whether to provide a loan to an individual or not. There were also situational problems such as – Given that Ph.D students have a higher default rate but high profits and MBA students have lower default rate and lower profits, how would you define your business. Overall my interview was nice and the panelists were not grilling.” ****** Mohammed Tariq , B.Tech in computer science in engineering, 10 months of experience in Business intelligence “Prior to joining the course, I described my experience of a 6-month certification course in analytics. I was also asked about statistics. They asked in-depth questions on calculus going to the levels at which I could not solve. Since I have already done a PG course which used R programming language, Tableau tool and projects, I answered what subjects I learned during the course, experience of the course and my development of interest in PGDBA after completing the course. The interview was mainly focused on my interests in analytics.” Analytics Experience IIM Calcutta Interview PGDBA Student Life students Post navigation Next Article Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge Previous Article PGDBA Interview Experiences – Part 2 Related Articles Interview Experiences PGDBA 2025-27 Interview Experiences Greetings, Future PGDBA Achievers!

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 12, 2017 No Comments on What is PGDBA? “Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.” – Geoffrey Moore, Organizational Theorist & Author Analytics: Need of the Hour The amount of data in our world is exploding. As per a McKinsey report, big data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function the same way as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition. The increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media and the Internet of Things will fuel exponential growth in data in the foreseeable future. The rapid pace with which data is being generated across various domains and fields would require people with deep analytical skills to provide insights, enabling companies to gain a competitive edge and offer a better consumer experience. The insights from the data are used for various purposes such as segmentation of customers for better targeting, prediction of churn rate, product recommendation, analysis of customer opinion from media posts, preventive maintenance, management of portfolio risk etc. Untapped potential in India In India, the analytics market is expected to double between 2013 and 2018, reaching a figure of US$ 2.3 billion by 2018, according to a report published by NASSCOM and Blueocean Market Intelligence. This will result in a shortage of about 200,000 data scientists in India over the next few years, according to sources in the Analytics Special Interest Group setup by NASSCOM. Hence, creation of trained industry-ready business analytics professionals is the need of the day. Globally, the demand of data scientists is projected to exceed supply by more than 50% by 2018. To address the paucity of trained workforce in analytics domain, the onus is on the educational institutes to address the needs of the industry. The three institutes IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata are aware of the demand for the well rounded analytics professionals. In order to understand the needs of the industry, a day long conclave was held in January 2015 in IIM Calcutta. Representatives of the leading companies such as KPMG, EXL, Deloitte, LatentView, TCS, Reliance Communication, Deutsche Bank, E&Y, SBI, IBM, Google, Microsoft, HSBC and Cognizant took part in the conclave and based on their inputs, ideas of a specialized course emerged, a course which would produce leaders of the future, skilled in the essential areas of business, statistics and computer science. Through this collaboration between industry and academia, PGDBA was born. Introduction to PGDBA PGDBA is a two year full time residential diploma programme aimed at creating business analytics professionals employable by leading Indian and foreign firms. This programme is designed for those who have an analytical mindset, are interested in tackling challenging business problems, and possess an inclination towards Mathematics. Some of the salient features of the programme include courses taught by reputed faculty members at the campuses of three globally renowned institutes, hands-on business analytics training at a related company, continuous interaction with industry leaders throughout the duration of the programme and the availability of placement opportunities at all the three institutes. The three institutes complement each other to give students the most comprehensive learning of business analytics. The course finds the optimal balance between the theoretical concepts of data science and their applications to business problems. Students get to regularly interact with industry experts through invited talks and guest lectures, where experts talk about the latest trends and challenges in the industry. The course leverages the best of the three institutes in their respective fields of expertise, i.e., Statistics, Technology and Business. In the first semester at ISI, students form a strong base of Mathematical and Statistical concepts. This is followed by a semester at IIT Kharagpur, where students work on data science projects and get to test their statistical concepts built at ISI. This semester is meant to build students’ technical expertise. To complement the first two semesters, students spend their third semester at IIM Calcutta where they are exposed to business problems through case studies and industry interactions. To cap it all, the students get to implement their knowledge in the industry through a six months long internship as their fourth semester. Placements The students from the first two batches of PGDBA experienced highly successful placement processes. Companies from various industries such as BFSI, Consulting, Healthcare, Research, Retail, Gaming, Technology etc. participated and handpicked candidates suitable for both data-driven and business driven analyst roles. The placement processes witnessed the involvement of Fortune 500 companies such as American Express, Walmart Labs, UnitedHealth Group, JPMC, Amazon, Walmart Labs. Some of the job profiles offered were Senior Data Scientist, Analytics Manager, Statistical Analyst, Lead Business Analyst, Solution Analyst, Experienced Associate, Assistant Project Manager. With continuously increasing demand of business analytics professionals, the future of PGDBA looks promising. The unique opportunity of learning from three top-notch institutes of the country is unparalleled by any other Data Analytics course. Recently, PGDBA was ranked 1 by the Analytics India Magazine among the data science courses offered in the country.

August 27, 2016 pgdba_admin ISI Chapter , Technical 0 Comments What do entropy, linear programming and Riemann surfaces have in common? Puzzled? Now imagine this connection explained by an eccentric speaker in the attire of a French stage magician, with the charm and virtuosity of a storyteller. Cedric Villani, French mathematician, Fields Medal awardee in the year 2010 and famously called by the NewYorker magazine as the ‘Lady Gaga of Mathematics’ delivered a public lecture titled ‘Of Triangles, Gases, Prices and Men’ at ISI on 26 th August 2016. The second PGDBA batch, currently in its first semester here at ISI, had the opportunity to be present at this intriguing and informative session. Cedric Villani The abstraction and intrigue of Cedric could be assumed from the fact that an introduction to him included a reference to the number of his pets. This abstraction could also be inferred from the title of his talk, which was a play on the title of John Steinbeck’s famous classic ‘Of Mice and Men.’ The first slide of his presentation was taken from Tennyson’s Lady of Shalott. In Cedric’s own interpretation, the Lady of Shalott, accursed to see the world only through a mirror, was actually an allegory to the mathematician forever accursed to look at reality through his equations! Cedric then said that there are many more unsolved mysteries in Mathematics today than there were a hundred years ago. There are ever so many new problems that keep arising. Then there are those age-old ones that lie in famous mathematicians’ lists of unsolved problems. One such famous unproved hypothesis is the Riemann hypothesis. This led Cedric down the path to explaining Riemann’s works and then to the first part of the evening’s presentation – ‘triangles’. He introduced to the audience Riemann surfaces and how Escher employed curved surfaces in his art. As examples of negative curvatures, he showed images of art installations in museums and models of coral reef. Einstein, with the help of his mathematician colleagues, used Riemann’s ideas to develop his General Theory of Relativity. Cedric went on to add that, the GPS technology so ubiquitous in the world today has its roots in Riemann’s works in topology. In a humorous turn of speech, Cedric noted that Riemann was as oblivious to his work being of practical use in 21 st century devices, as modern day GPS users were to Riemann’s surfaces. An ironic symmetry indeed! At this turn of his presentation, Cedric spoke about how it is equally important for scientists to pursue inspiration and not just utility. He marked out Riemann as someone who was particularly interested in approaching problems in his own unique way. Cedric quoted Poincare who had once said, “Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.” The second part of his talk on ‘gases’ started with a description of his visit to Vienna and a search for Boltzmann’s grave. He said that he stopped to ask a family for a map not expecting them to know Boltzmann, let alone his grave. To his surprise, he was not only directed to the location of the grave but the person also exclaimed Boltzmann’s equation of entropy, “S=klogW”! In connection with entropy, he then talked about the Gaussian curve, its ubiquitous nature and its uncanny appearance in many natural systems. He called the study of Probability and Statistics as ‘the extraordinary adventure of mastering of chance.’ As a matter of coincidence, he discussed a famous problem in his presentation called ‘Buffon’s needle’, which was also discussed in class earlier on the same day with the PGDBA students by their lecturer. Experiments such as coin tosses, Cedric said, are best done in the most careless ways! Then he explained how gases are modeled as billiard balls in collision and when there are many such sufficiently small billiard balls, their velocities are accurately modeled as the Gaussian distribution. As a note, Cedric remarked on the power of this distribution by quoting Sir Francis Galton who once called it the ‘supreme law of unreason.’ The next part of his presentation was ‘prices’. Cedric introduced Leonid Kantorovic, the father of linear programming. He explained how math is used to model the optimal allocation of resources. He then strung together ideas from the optimized distribution of resources to the distribution of gas molecules with the least loss of energy. The analogy of prices in linear programming is energy in distribution of gas molecules. This is where Cedric began piecing everything together with the last part of his talk called ‘men’. Cedric described how he had happened to meet his collaborators John Lott and Felix Otto. These men put together the ‘triangles’, ‘gases’ and ‘prices’ and helped Cedric complete his research on how fast gases reach the equilibrium stage described in Boltzmann’s equation. Cedric was awarded the Fields medal in connection with this research. What would have been an intimidating subject matter coming from volumes over volumes of text, was aptly introduced in a two-hour lecture by Cedric Villani, a master at his trade, a storyteller par excellence, a dinosaur catcher in his childhood dreams and a true ambassador of modern mathematics. In a surprising irony of sorts, apart from the many hidden mysteries in the details of his works, the most apparent mystery is the brooches of spiders that he wears on the lapels of his coat!

In winter, Calcutta and the ISI campus seem to be embedded in a timescale of their own. The cool climate, with the leisure of end of semester break and the occasional chai in little earthen cups are an apt climax to a wonderful first leg of the PGDBA course here at ISI. We had the opportunity to attend a lecture delivered by Dr. Sourav Sengupta held in the same Machine Learning workshop this week. Souravda, as he insisted we must call him when we first met in July, taught us a course titled ‘Computing for Data Science’ in this semester’s coursework. The topic of his workshop lecture on Tuesday was Linear Algebra and I couldn’t help but smile as I reminisced the most enjoyable classroom experience that I had in the past semester. When I decided on writing this piece I was lost for ideas on how to do justice, in the measure of just a few words, to a semester’s worth of constantly brilliant teaching. Just plain superlatives for Dr. Sourav Sengupta would not suffice to explain the privilege I feel in being his student. There are many moments in class that I felt amazed as he walked us through a topic, drawing out concept after concept, most times exercising the last resource of our grey cells. With his characteristic smiles and pauses, he conducted the class like an orchestra maestro. He was always thoroughly prepared with the flow of his lectures that were packed with information and insight. Maybe trying to recap a few highlights would help reflect the memorable journey we’ve had in class. Of our first few trysts in Souravda’s class was the one with Linear Algebra. He introduced matrix multiplication as an operation on vector spaces. Starting with linear combinations of vectors and the space they spanned, he guided us to a vector space representation of the linear least squares estimate of a system of equations. This might seem arcane to some, but the charm was in the ease with which he explained the ideas of multidimensional spaces and vectors in the context of something as simple as least squares approximation. Another of such crescendos was when he tied eigen values, Markov chains and the power method in a lecture on how Google first developed a base for ranking webpages called PageRank. It was almost a revelation when I first realised, “So this is a Markov chain!” In another lecture, Souravda explained the notion of volume as it applies to higher dimensions. He compared a unit ball with a unit square. A unit square in two dimensions is completely contained inside a unit ball. The farthest that a square can get from the origin is root of 1/2 (1/4 +1/4 = 2/4) whereas a unit circle is at a fixed distance of 1 . In three dimensions, a cuboid is still inside a sphere and the farthest it gets to is square root of 3/4 . Now, as we move up to four dimensions, the farthest point inside the ‘box’ is at square root of 4/4 which is 1 . So in four dimensions, the box just touches the ball but is still contained entirely inside it. “What happens, when we move higher up”, asked Souravda in class. It so happens that the unit box creeps out of the ball in the fifth dimension and further up, in still higher dimensions, most of the volume of the box is not contained inside the ball. This was just one aspect of the notion of distances that he discussed. In another class, we discussed the distance between two sentences or text corpuses to see how similar or different they were. And as measures of similarity of two sets, Souravda then introduced us to hash functions and MinHashing. “How would you develop a system to choose one person from three people, uniformly at random, by using just the outcomes of coin tosses?” This is one of Prof. Bimal Roy’s favourite questions (previous Director and professor of MathStat department) that Souravda introduced in class with us. He then extended the discussion to choosing uniformly at random from n people and then on to storing streaming data in an efficient way. PCA, SVD, Linear Regression and Regularisation, Clustering, Classification and Regression Trees, Bias-Variance Trade-off in learning algorithms, SVM, Recommender Systems, Expectation Maximisation are the other broad topics that he discussed at a constant level of commitment and brilliance. And that is just his teaching. There’s another side to the person that is Souravda. His utmost sincerity and dedication, at times when it seemed unimaginable why a person should go so far out of his way to help, was an immeasurable gift during the course. At times when he explained algorithms for certain applications, he would use the common refrain, “But can you do any better?” in trying to guide us to more efficient solutions. A lesson that Souravda’s students could take from his classes, of which his own dedication was sufficient evidence, was to keep asking themselves, “Can you do any better?” Thank you and farewell, Dr. Sourav Sengupta.

Prioritize maximizing the written exam score so that you have a cushion and can afford to mess up a bit in the interview and still make it. You need to have your +2 level math concepts rock-solid to ace the written exam, and as for VARC and DILR, some CAT type mocks might help since not a lot of content specifically geared towards PGDBA is available yet. DILR is generally very scoring so you should try to get all correct. For interview, be absolutely confident with whatever work you do, and if you’re a fresher, be confident in your undergrad or postgrad course subjects. Try having an idea about how you could incorporate analytics into your work field and why you wanna switch to analytics (if you are switching), and have a concrete understanding of the basics of linear algebra, probability and statistics. And of course, don’t forget the general affairs!

The classes were held initially at the Kolmogorov bhavan. Within a month we were given our own classroom in the Satyendra Nath Bose Bhavan. Kolmogorov bhavan, ISI Our curriculum consisted of 5 subjects. The subjects and the professors involved were: Statistical inference – Amitava Banerjee Stochastic processes – Dr. Bimal Roy & Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta Computing for data sciences – Dr. Sourav Sengupta Statistical structures in data – Debashish Sengupta Database Management Systems – Dr. Pinakpani Pal & Amiya Das By far the stars of the course were the faculty members. It was an honour to interact with a Padma Shree awardee in Dr. Bimal Roy. To be taught on a regular basis by such an esteemed personality was slightly overwhelming and hugely enriching. The sheer brilliance of the man and his way of looking at probability and its applications was an experience difficult to pen down. Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta shared the course and taught Markov Chains. Satyendra Nath bhavan , ISI Campus Diligent and sincere, Prof. Debashish Sengupta was the ideal teacher. He covered every topic rigorously starting right with the basics of statistics to the highly complex multivariate analysis. What seemed an easy course initially, became heavily loaded and among the toughest by the time the course came to its completion. Tutorials were held every week to discuss exercise problems. The jovial Prof. Amitava Banerjee taught us the habit of drawing meaningful inferences out of large volumes of data. Drawing from his vast pool of consultancy experience, he inculcated in us the ability to convert real life business problems into statistical problems. His assignments involved working on datasets and testing hypothesis in the correct way. Dr. Pinakpani Pal was interactive, and worked hard to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. His course had 2 parts: the theoretical knowledge of databases, and a hands-on SQL application. He shared the course with Amiya Das, a seasoned professional at Oracle. The friendly and ever enthusiastic Dr Sourav Sengupta was always approachable and motivated the entire batch in getting accustomed with highly complex ideas. His passion for teaching shone through as he went through the concepts of linear algebra and machine learning algorithms. He organised the course superbly and the web page for his course was among the best resource repositories we could have hoped for. The invited lectures were top drawer, with experienced professionals coming in to share their insights and recommendations about the field of analytics. Overall the first semester was a learning experience beyond compare and laid a solid foundation on which we can build in our journey towards becoming well-rounded data scientists.

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:27 am We’re not the conveners of the upcoming test and hence it would be hard to give an accurate measure for this year’s test. However, we will look into the possibility of suggestions for its preparations and last year’s test. Meanwhile, do enjoy the articles!

December 12, 2017 pgdba_admin About Us , General 0 Comments “Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.” – Geoffrey Moore, Organizational Theorist & Author Analytics: Need of the Hour The amount of data in our world is exploding. As per a McKinsey report, big data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function the same way as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition. The increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media and the Internet of Things will fuel exponential growth in data in the foreseeable future. The rapid pace with which data is being generated across various domains and fields would require people with deep analytical skills to provide insights, enabling companies to gain a competitive edge and offer a better consumer experience. The insights from the data are used for various purposes such as segmentation of customers for better targeting, prediction of churn rate, product recommendation, analysis of customer opinion from media posts, preventive maintenance, management of portfolio risk etc. Untapped potential in India In India, the analytics market is expected to double between 2013 and 2018, reaching a figure of US$ 2.3 billion by 2018, according to a report published by NASSCOM and Blueocean Market Intelligence. This will result in a shortage of about 200,000 data scientists in India over the next few years, according to sources in the Analytics Special Interest Group setup by NASSCOM. Hence, creation of trained industry-ready business analytics professionals is the need of the day. Globally, the demand of data scientists is projected to exceed supply by more than 50% by 2018. To address the paucity of trained workforce in analytics domain, the onus is on the educational institutes to address the needs of the industry. The three institutes IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata are aware of the demand for the well rounded analytics professionals. In order to understand the needs of the industry, a day long conclave was held in January 2015 in IIM Calcutta. Representatives of the leading companies such as KPMG, EXL, Deloitte, LatentView, TCS, Reliance Communication, Deutsche Bank, E&Y, SBI, IBM, Google, Microsoft, HSBC and Cognizant took part in the conclave and based on their inputs, ideas of a specialized course emerged, a course which would produce leaders of the future, skilled in the essential areas of business, statistics and computer science. Through this collaboration between industry and academia, PGDBA was born. Introduction to PGDBA PGDBA is a two year full time residential diploma programme aimed at creating business analytics professionals employable by leading Indian and foreign firms. This programme is designed for those who have an analytical mindset, are interested in tackling challenging business problems, and possess an inclination towards Mathematics. Some of the salient features of the programme include courses taught by reputed faculty members at the campuses of three globally renowned institutes, hands-on business analytics training at a related company, continuous interaction with industry leaders throughout the duration of the programme and the availability of placement opportunities at all the three institutes. The three institutes complement each other to give students the most comprehensive learning of business analytics. The course finds the optimal balance between the theoretical concepts of data science and their applications to business problems. Students get to regularly interact with industry experts through invited talks and guest lectures, where experts talk about the latest trends and challenges in the industry. The course leverages the best of the three institutes in their respective fields of expertise, i.e., Statistics, Technology and Business. In the first semester at ISI, students form a strong base of Mathematical and Statistical concepts. This is followed by a semester at IIT Kharagpur, where students work on data science projects and get to test their statistical concepts built at ISI. This semester is meant to build students’ technical expertise. To complement the first two semesters, students spend their third semester at IIM Calcutta where they are exposed to business problems through case studies and industry interactions. To cap it all, the students get to implement their knowledge in the industry through a six months long internship as their fourth semester. Placements The students from the first two batches of PGDBA experienced highly successful placement processes. Companies from various industries such as BFSI, Consulting, Healthcare, Research, Retail, Gaming, Technology etc. participated and handpicked candidates suitable for both data-driven and business driven analyst roles. The placement processes witnessed the involvement of Fortune 500 companies such as American Express, Walmart Labs, UnitedHealth Group, JPMC, Amazon, Walmart Labs. Some of the job profiles offered were Senior Data Scientist, Analytics Manager, Statistical Analyst, Lead Business Analyst, Solution Analyst, Experienced Associate, Assistant Project Manager. With continuously increasing demand of business analytics professionals, the future of PGDBA looks promising. The unique opportunity of learning from three top-notch institutes of the country is unparalleled by any other Data Analytics course. Recently, PGDBA was ranked 1 by the Analytics India Magazine among the data science courses offered in the country.

Apart from the assessment brief, you will be given the learning outcomes and performance criteria to know what is expected in the project from the learner.

For further information, visit http://springboardcourses.ie This Postgraduate Diploma in Business in Business Analytics provides learners with advanced specialised technical and research skills and competencies in business analytics. Business analytics is the repeated examination of an organisation’s data with an emphasis on using statistical analytical tools and techniques to uncover insights to support innovation, decision-making and overall success in assessing and enhancing the performance of vital operations. Students will be able to lead and implement appropriate analytics solutions to inform decisions in a business environment on complex management, technical and functional areas relating to organisations, products, processes, and services. Online Delivery Practices The online delivery of this postgraduate degree leverages advanced digital technologies and platforms to optimise student engagement and learning outcomes. Central to this mode is a flipped classroom approach, where students access prepared materials – such as customised video content, open educational resources, presentations, recorded practical demonstrations, and reference notes- before participating in live, interactive sessions. These sessions, delivered via the LMS and a suite of remote laboratory facilities, promote active learning through tutorials, practical exercises, discussion forums, and live audio-visual interactions. Additional strategies, including self-assessment quizzes and hands-on activities, ensure knowledge consolidation while fostering independent study. Signposting techniques and well-structured resources guide learners effectively, creating a clear and supportive learning journey. A comprehensive suite of remote laboratory facilities has been created specifically for this programme, including remote laboratories and virtual desktops, using an Azure cloud platform. The programme team have also engaged with the HigherEd4.0 project ( https://www.highered4.ie/ ) to improve the online learning resources, including generating new interactive content, and re-designing online delivery using a UDL approach, in collaboration with a learning design team.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

Capitalise on the common types and practice a few tough ones as well since cutoff will go extremely high due to competition. I would recommend practising mocks as well as completing the whole syllabus for the exam. 2. interview: Anything goes tbh. You cannot predict the 15 mins allocated to you. Be Confident and get your interview fundamentals right. Fundamentals include: Tell Me About Yourself Why PGDBA Work ex (if your work ex is in analytics expect heavy questioning here, your interview most likely will run here if you have a analytics background.) Future Prospects Strengths and Weaknesses After Fundamentals get to puzzle solving from Geeks for Geeks, again here is only a few handfuls of patterns available just understand the fundamental logic. Finally, learn linear regression (in-depth) and revise graduation math. Apart from technical aspects, try to complete all the news videos from StudyIQ from January to the Date of your interview in descending order i.e. first complete the current month’s news and slowly if time permits work your way towards the old news.

My preparation also focused on these areas, and I even tried to steer the interview towards math through my intro. However, they asked me mechanical engineering questions instead. If you have a basic understanding of your field, you’ll be able to handle those questions as well.

No General Interview Questions based on your work experience and profile No Introduction & No Why PGDBA 1. Give two concepts of Mechanical Engg. being applied in your day-to-day work. Talked about Unloading of Argon Gas (flow of gas from high pressure to low pressure & Cooling Tower Fills) 2. What is R in PV = nRT? What will happen to the temperature inside a tank when its pressure increases? What is the name of this law? 3. Does temperature increase or decrease during evaporation? Increase in surface area cause more cooling. Name this principle. Didn’t know the exact answer so explained evaporative cooling. Mathematics and Statistics related interview questions 1. Asked to draw dots on a graph like Linear Regression and then draw a line through it. What is the best fit of the line? Classic case of Linear Regression. What is Mean of Squared errors? How is MSE optimized in case of Linear Regression? Talked about Gradient Descent & Partial Differentiations. 2. What is the distribution of (y-y’) w.r.t. x, (y-y’) w.r.t. y & (y-y’) ^2 w.r.t. y. Here (y-y’) is the residual. I didn’t know much about this, and we discussed few things about Heteroskedasticity & assumptions behind Linear Regressions.

If yes, please specify the details. No Tips for Interview 1. PGDBA written exam: Taking CAT & XAT can help one with DILR & English. JEE Mains Maths PYQs are enough to prepare one for the Maths Part. 2. Interview Preparation needs to be on point as it is the make or break for PGDBA irrespective of anything. 3. Prepare 2 subjects from B.Tech stream & subjects common to Work Experience. 4. Have a basic know how of ML/AI & uses of AI/ML in your work domain. If you know any such project, then prepare some content. 5. Expect the unexpected. I have appeared in the PGDBA interviews for 4 consecutive years and every year was a different experience. 6. Never prepare topics in which you are not much confident yourself.

The panelists will definitely ask you tough questions to observe how you are going to act in that situation, so don’t fret even if you don’t understand the question, be calm and act patiently. (In my case, I was asked politics questions even though when I told them I am not that good with that and let me tell you I couldn’t answer even one properly but now after selection when I look back, I understand what their motive must have been.) Just cover the basics of statistics and don’t exaggerate in the resume or interview. Only say what you know and what you think. Best of luck to all the aspirants.

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Reply Venkatesh says: January 16, 2016 at 9:17 am Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:36 am For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well. Reply Hardik Agarwal says: March 27, 2016 at 12:44 pm URGENT : If I don’t have an important document that has to be shown during the interview process in original (as said in the call letter), can I show its copy and give an undertaking of that? Will it work or will they cancel my candidature? Thanks in advance. Reply Madhur Modi says: April 20, 2016 at 10:04 am The interviews are already over. I think you would have already received the instructions from the panel about this Reply subhodeep says: April 19, 2016 at 10:28 am hi, i converted my PGDBA call. i am looking forward to join this course and very optimistic about it. just need to convince myself that avg salary will be equivalent to PGDM of IIMC. how is the industry perceiving this course. are companies like BCG and MCG lined up for PGDBA? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:00 pm Hi.. did you join the course?? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:01 pm What was last year’s cut-off to get the admissions?

December 18, 2015 pgdba_admin Campus Life 5 Comments Here comes our atta boy, our cheerful Madhur Modi to speak about our first semester at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. He is a CS grad, tinted with the experience of working in Acrobat Team, Adobe, India for 11 months. Let’s hear what Madhur says! After a not-so long orientation and pre-semester at IIM C, it was time to move to ISI. All of us were already feeling the attachment we had built with each other and formed the spirit of ‘joka tribe’ within ourselves. We started our journey to learn and started packing… but we were not done with the pre-semester yet! 🙂 Not before we can have a last photo-session! Even the journey to ISI was an insightful one! Filled with discussions of memories made within the short month. Happy faces! I remember us all at the peak of our enthusiasm when we visited ISI for the first time after the orientation, this time for around 6 months with knowledge imparted from renowned teachers. Since each of us had opted for the hostel facilities, the registration day was spent in lodging and document formalities. It all began with 5 subjects, 8 teachers and 51 students – daily two hour classes, twice daily where a moment of flickering attention meant you’ll lose the ability to grasp anything for the rest of the class. Yes! We had teachers who could teach us their subject continuously for two hours and every moment… each of them they made us wonder how amazing it is to learn in an enjoyable fashion. We all felt so comfortable moving from our 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional minds to nth dimensions and then move down using multidimensional scaling ☺ ☺ (was I too technical here? Come to ISI and you’ll know what I mean). I bet all our teachers from ISI would be laughing reading the joke here. By the ways, if you’re writing about ISI, it won’t be a just article if you do not mention each teacher separately! Starting from our class teacher and DBMS teacher prof. Pinakpani Pal, it was him who would come to our rescue each time, whether it is to change the mess, requirement of any additional facilities, aid in any procedures or help regarding the subject. He would kindly reach out his hand and solve all our problems in a flick. DBMS was also taught by prof. Amiya and prof. Dilip who would take care of SQL teaching for us. Thanks to him, DBMS was one of the most comfortable subjects in ISI. I still remember the fact that 44 teachers have bhattacharya awards in their name! We all used to marvel at the level of knowledge at ISI, rather, we felt grateful to our teachers for feeding such golden nuggets of information to us daily and Prof. Debasis is the teacher who’s teaching reminded us the reasons they won those awards. I always felt that he teaches one subject but I learned things anyone would consider is worth much more! From histograms, scatter plots, distributions and tests for distributions, he took us to bivariate and the multivariate analysis followed by more tests and feature selection. Moreover, he took extra classes and doubt sessions every week just to ensure that when we learn, we learn well When you start talking about the teachers, each teacher is better than the other! We had Statistical Probabilistic Analysis taught by two teachers, Prof. Bimal and Prof. Kishan. It was the only subject with no assignments, since probability has such a wide scope. This class was all practical, we were given real life examples and applied concepts to solve them. There was yet another similar subject, inference, taught by Prof. Amitava which encompassed all other subjects and drew inference tests from each of them, filled with more real life examples. We had one more course, or rather, set of course ☺ Computing in data science taught by Prof. Saurav Sengupta. I could proudly say to those non-cse students who fear how they would learn programming techniques- this is the course that will help you make your first transition. From practically negligible knowledge, this course taught us not just R and Python, but also made us do an entire team project to deep seat the lessons in our hearts. The best thing? We had fun! I would frequently visit the course website and our project blog and proudly say that we have come far, far from where we were when we entered ISI. P.S. do check out the blog of group 1 authored by our group. 🙂 Didn’t I mention anything else besides studies? How forgetful of me! ISI is a place of happenings! Every other day there were announcements of workshops in various fields of statistics and there were a variety of activities which would now be sweet memories for us with ISI. We flew kites, we had birthday parties, we played games and we had our first formal photoshoot! Looking smart! ISI also had a very special memory… Diwali! What’s that? How did we celebrate it? I could boast that it was better than any student had celebrated while at college! Two of our batchmates, Mr. Avinash (a.k.a. Gandhi) and Mukul cleaned their room and turned it into the Pooja venue (see photos in link) We made diyas, did Pooja, sang bhakti songs, distributed Prasad and made rangoli ! We burnt a few crackers and all our rooms illuminated with the auspiciousness on that day! It was one of the best Diwali celebrations of my life! Diwali! Soon after Durga puja, Diwali and Kali puja, we had our final exams and had to say “Bye Bye ISI” I am thankful that our first semester was conducted at ISI where we learnt such a great deal and progressed so far ahead in our skills. It already feels like we can do most of business analytics even though we have ways to go. How could be go away without saying a delightful adios to our Indian Statistical institute? We requested all the teachers to come for a final photoshoot session. Besides one photo present in CDS website , another photo from the last day would mark a fitting ending to our memories and knowledge lending roller coaster ride at the pillar of statistical, mathematical and machine learning institute!

I hope you have applied! ABHISHEK AGRAWAL January 19, 2016 Reply I have applied for the test. Could you please tell me what to expect in interview from your experience as i have around 2 months to prepare for it. Madhur Modi January 20, 2016 Reply At this point, do focus on the written test first. You should again be prepared with mathematics for the interview as well. Most of the other questions besides maths are similar to a typical IIM interview. You will need to prepare additional topics as well such as probability and differentiation. Based on your profile, some specific questions might be asked. Also, stay tuned for future posts on the blog where we may post further insights!

I am convinced that recording my first impressions of this maddening, surreal odyssey that I have set out on will not only prove to be fruitful in retrospect, but in fact help me in retaining my sanity in the present. For those of you who have been wondering what I’m going to blabber about, I would like to give you some context before you abandon me. I am now a student at the PGDBA program. I am comfortably living in my posh suite of the guesthouse of IIM C, with my amazing roommate, situated in Joka, which is nearly thirty kilometers away from the city of Kolkata. There are one hundred and three other students in this program who live with me, so I am sometimes tempted to forget that we are literally in the middle of nowhere. We are being fed an illusion – but an irresistible one that I don’t have the heart to snap out of. In some ways, the fact that the city is beyond my reach is liberating. The five years I spent living in the heart of Delhi, and then another two years in the legendary city of Mumbai, I craved for an escape, for a way out. I think this program has finally answered my call for help. Here, I am constantly told that I am special, that I am the chosen one. The twenty-four years of my life that have led to this moment have made me so cynical that I doubt their belief in me. But at the same time, I greatly value it. After a very long time, I am around people who are willing to invest in my future simply because the three accomplished panel members saw a spark in me, during the twenty-five minutes I spent interviewing for the program. I feel humbled and terrified. The two years ahead are going to demand every inch of me, it is going to consume me, and it is going to change me. But for so long I have felt nothing, that this rush, this constant buzz in my head, this restlessness feels good. I am sleep-deprived, surviving on n number of cups of terribly made tea and coffee and hopping from one assignment to the other with some extended breaks thankfully, and yet, I am alive. How often is it that you are so committed to the moment that every other structure inside and outside your mind breaks form, and this particular moment is all that you can see, all that you can register? This program is one such moment in my life. The program, which aims at producing a team of unparalleled business analysts and data scientists, supposedly the sexiest job in the market these days, has been ideated by the three premiere institutes of India – Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This very credibility generates the “Pygmalion effect” and drives me to excel in the area of analytics. The coming two years make me realize, that I’m far away from the comfort zone and stability that life had offered just before I decided to enroll into PGDBA. But I am also glad that it happened, for I can now appreciate the morning for what it truly represents – a fresh start. I like the concept of this new beginning, for it brings with it the exciting journey of exploring new dimensions and reconstruct your identity. I am tempted to fantasize about the future, but I am trying to contain my excitement to the moment. So many paths seem to call out to me that my brain will explode if I start to think too much. What do I want, you ask? Organized chaos. If you think that is romantically abstract, then you have understood me just a little more than you did before you began to read this note. I will end with a few lines that so perfectly describe my state of mind right now, that I might just marry Robert Frost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

The classes were held initially at the Kolmogorov bhavan. Within a month we were given our own classroom in the Satyendra Nath Bose Bhavan. Kolmogorov bhavan, ISI Our curriculum consisted of 5 subjects. The subjects and the professors involved were: Statistical inference – Amitava Banerjee Stochastic processes – Dr. Bimal Roy & Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta Computing for data sciences – Dr. Sourav Sengupta Statistical structures in data – Debashish Sengupta Database Management Systems – Dr. Pinakpani Pal & Amiya Das By far the stars of the course were the faculty members. It was an honour to interact with a Padma Shree awardee in Dr. Bimal Roy. To be taught on a regular basis by such an esteemed personality was slightly overwhelming and hugely enriching. The sheer brilliance of the man and his way of looking at probability and its applications was an experience difficult to pen down. Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta shared the course and taught Markov Chains. Satyendra Nath bhavan , ISI Campus Diligent and sincere, Prof. Debashish Sengupta was the ideal teacher. He covered every topic rigorously starting right with the basics of statistics to the highly complex multivariate analysis. What seemed an easy course initially, became heavily loaded and among the toughest by the time the course came to its completion. Tutorials were held every week to discuss exercise problems. The jovial Prof. Amitava Banerjee taught us the habit of drawing meaningful inferences out of large volumes of data. Drawing from his vast pool of consultancy experience, he inculcated in us the ability to convert real life business problems into statistical problems. His assignments involved working on datasets and testing hypothesis in the correct way. Dr. Pinakpani Pal was interactive, and worked hard to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. His course had 2 parts: the theoretical knowledge of databases, and a hands-on SQL application. He shared the course with Amiya Das, a seasoned professional at Oracle. The friendly and ever enthusiastic Dr Sourav Sengupta was always approachable and motivated the entire batch in getting accustomed with highly complex ideas. His passion for teaching shone through as he went through the concepts of linear algebra and machine learning algorithms. He organised the course superbly and the web page for his course was among the best resource repositories we could have hoped for. The invited lectures were top drawer, with experienced professionals coming in to share their insights and recommendations about the field of analytics. Overall the first semester was a learning experience beyond compare and laid a solid foundation on which we can build in our journey towards becoming well-rounded data scientists. Our hostel, Deshmukh Bhavan Tags Experience , ISI , Student Life Categories General Prospects of PGDBA – The Million Dollar Question Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 4, 2015 14 Comments on Prospects of PGDBA – The Million Dollar Question One of the most common questions that we have come across in the past few days is – How would placements/internships be? Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program. Tags Analytics , PGDBA , placements , students Categories About Us What is PGDBA? Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge A Record, a Code and Twitter FINTECH Hackathon by NPCI at IIMC Foreign Internships: Ambassadors of PGDBA Chances of Consequence Categories General Prospects of PGDBA – The Million Dollar Question Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 4, 2015 14 Comments on Prospects of PGDBA – The Million Dollar Question One of the most common questions that we have come across in the past few days is – How would placements/internships be? Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Reply Venkatesh says: January 16, 2016 at 9:17 am Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:36 am For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well. Reply Hardik Agarwal says: March 27, 2016 at 12:44 pm URGENT : If I don’t have an important document that has to be shown during the interview process in original (as said in the call letter), can I show its copy and give an undertaking of that? Will it work or will they cancel my candidature? Thanks in advance. Reply Madhur Modi says: April 20, 2016 at 10:04 am The interviews are already over. I think you would have already received the instructions from the panel about this Reply subhodeep says: April 19, 2016 at 10:28 am hi, i converted my PGDBA call. i am looking forward to join this course and very optimistic about it. just need to convince myself that avg salary will be equivalent to PGDM of IIMC. how is the industry perceiving this course. are companies like BCG and MCG lined up for PGDBA? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:00 pm Hi.. did you join the course?? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:01 pm What was last year’s cut-off to get the admissions?

August 27, 2016 pgdba_admin ISI Chapter , Technical 0 Comments What do entropy, linear programming and Riemann surfaces have in common? Puzzled? Now imagine this connection explained by an eccentric speaker in the attire of a French stage magician, with the charm and virtuosity of a storyteller. Cedric Villani, French mathematician, Fields Medal awardee in the year 2010 and famously called by the NewYorker magazine as the ‘Lady Gaga of Mathematics’ delivered a public lecture titled ‘Of Triangles, Gases, Prices and Men’ at ISI on 26 th August 2016. The second PGDBA batch, currently in its first semester here at ISI, had the opportunity to be present at this intriguing and informative session. Cedric Villani The abstraction and intrigue of Cedric could be assumed from the fact that an introduction to him included a reference to the number of his pets. This abstraction could also be inferred from the title of his talk, which was a play on the title of John Steinbeck’s famous classic ‘Of Mice and Men.’ The first slide of his presentation was taken from Tennyson’s Lady of Shalott. In Cedric’s own interpretation, the Lady of Shalott, accursed to see the world only through a mirror, was actually an allegory to the mathematician forever accursed to look at reality through his equations! Cedric then said that there are many more unsolved mysteries in Mathematics today than there were a hundred years ago. There are ever so many new problems that keep arising. Then there are those age-old ones that lie in famous mathematicians’ lists of unsolved problems. One such famous unproved hypothesis is the Riemann hypothesis. This led Cedric down the path to explaining Riemann’s works and then to the first part of the evening’s presentation – ‘triangles’. He introduced to the audience Riemann surfaces and how Escher employed curved surfaces in his art. As examples of negative curvatures, he showed images of art installations in museums and models of coral reef. Einstein, with the help of his mathematician colleagues, used Riemann’s ideas to develop his General Theory of Relativity. Cedric went on to add that, the GPS technology so ubiquitous in the world today has its roots in Riemann’s works in topology. In a humorous turn of speech, Cedric noted that Riemann was as oblivious to his work being of practical use in 21 st century devices, as modern day GPS users were to Riemann’s surfaces. An ironic symmetry indeed! At this turn of his presentation, Cedric spoke about how it is equally important for scientists to pursue inspiration and not just utility. He marked out Riemann as someone who was particularly interested in approaching problems in his own unique way. Cedric quoted Poincare who had once said, “Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.” The second part of his talk on ‘gases’ started with a description of his visit to Vienna and a search for Boltzmann’s grave. He said that he stopped to ask a family for a map not expecting them to know Boltzmann, let alone his grave. To his surprise, he was not only directed to the location of the grave but the person also exclaimed Boltzmann’s equation of entropy, “S=klogW”! In connection with entropy, he then talked about the Gaussian curve, its ubiquitous nature and its uncanny appearance in many natural systems. He called the study of Probability and Statistics as ‘the extraordinary adventure of mastering of chance.’ As a matter of coincidence, he discussed a famous problem in his presentation called ‘Buffon’s needle’, which was also discussed in class earlier on the same day with the PGDBA students by their lecturer. Experiments such as coin tosses, Cedric said, are best done in the most careless ways! Then he explained how gases are modeled as billiard balls in collision and when there are many such sufficiently small billiard balls, their velocities are accurately modeled as the Gaussian distribution. As a note, Cedric remarked on the power of this distribution by quoting Sir Francis Galton who once called it the ‘supreme law of unreason.’ The next part of his presentation was ‘prices’. Cedric introduced Leonid Kantorovic, the father of linear programming. He explained how math is used to model the optimal allocation of resources. He then strung together ideas from the optimized distribution of resources to the distribution of gas molecules with the least loss of energy. The analogy of prices in linear programming is energy in distribution of gas molecules. This is where Cedric began piecing everything together with the last part of his talk called ‘men’. Cedric described how he had happened to meet his collaborators John Lott and Felix Otto. These men put together the ‘triangles’, ‘gases’ and ‘prices’ and helped Cedric complete his research on how fast gases reach the equilibrium stage described in Boltzmann’s equation. Cedric was awarded the Fields medal in connection with this research. What would have been an intimidating subject matter coming from volumes over volumes of text, was aptly introduced in a two-hour lecture by Cedric Villani, a master at his trade, a storyteller par excellence, a dinosaur catcher in his childhood dreams and a true ambassador of modern mathematics. In a surprising irony of sorts, apart from the many hidden mysteries in the details of his works, the most apparent mystery is the brooches of spiders that he wears on the lapels of his coat!

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics?

Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand.

It seems a bit confusing at the start but soon one gets fascinated by it. The fact that each aspect of business analytics is taught by a specialized institute seems like a perfect horses-for-courses strategy. When I first heard about it, there was one name out of the three which captured my imagination the most and made me take this course seriously. That was ISI Kolkata – the pinnacle for statisticians. It is not to say that IIT Kharagpur and IIM Calcutta are insignificant names – popularity-wise that would be opposite – but the fact that an institute which is known more for its research-oriented approach, and not for focussing on fat pay checks, was a part of this curriculum made me think that I might actually learn something in this course and not just bide my time until the placement season. Hence I can say that ISI is one of the primary reasons for me being in this course. Now that the ISI phase is over I feel it imperative to share my experience. Due to space constraints, I will limit this article to my academic experience and not the student life there. We studied 5 courses there and though I will not be able to do justice to each of them in this short space, I will try my best to give an overview of what we studied in each course. 1. Stochastic Processes and its Applications : Randomness is the true foundation of mathematics. – Gregory Chaitin This course can be thought of as 3-in-1. It started with probability problems (check out gambler’s ruin problem if gambling is your thing), their ingenious solutions and then expanded to probability distributions. In almost no time at all, we shifted gears from simple coin tosses to complex problems involving combinations of probability and calculus. When we got done with it all in one month, we found out that it was a precursor to stochastic processes. We then spent a good amount of time studying Markov chains which has innumerable practical applications in today’s world (Google’s PageRank algorithm). If that was not enough in one semester, we also got an introduction to time series forecasting in final stages of the course. Probability, Stochastic Processes and Time Series forecasting – All three have the potential to be a separate course in themselves for one whole semester. While we couldn’t cover each one of them extensively, the course was a good starting point for someone looking for further studies in this area. It also covered enough of the three sub-topics so that we wouldn’t be sitting ducks when facing practical problems in this subject. 2. Statistical Structures in Data : Statistics is the grammar of science. – Karl Pearson Arguably the most important course of the semester. This course dwelled into pure statistics which started from simple properties of a distribution such as mean, median, variance, etc. We then moved to solve regression problems which started from univariate and culminated in multivariate statistics. This course also introduced us to various concepts in machine learning such as PCA, Factor Analysis, GLM and Decision Trees. Don’t worry if all these terms look Chinese to you, many of us weren’t aware of it either before stepping into ISI. Going by the internship interview experience of the first batch of PGDBA, it was considered to be the most important course. I believe that is because being a data analyst is not about being able to run a code in a software, rather it is about understanding the concepts behind the scenes and use that to extract maximum information. This course does exactly that. 3. Inferences: It is a hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow; and this means that we do not know whether it will rise. – Ludwig Wittgenstein English is never going to be the same for you once you attend this course. This course gave a glimpse into how technical can one get into statistics. We found that many things which would seem a mere nuisance to a ‘normal’ person actually have a lot of difference when it comes to statistics. Likelihood and Probability take on a new meaning altogether; Parameter, Statistic, Estimator and Estimate will always seem like a case of so-near-yet-so-far. We also covered the concept of hypothesis testing and its applications. Any statistics-101 book will have these topics and this particular course coupled with the one above forms the crux for which one comes to ISI. It is quite easy to commit mistakes in statistics by missing out on one or two seemingly trivial assumptions. This course taught us to be really careful with what we state and what we assume. At the same time, it taught us concepts which have direct applications in the real world and in the realm of statistics. 4. Computing for Data Sciences (CDS) : Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid; humans are slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are powerful beyond imagination. – Leo Cherne (This quote is often wrongly attributed to Einstein) One of my batch-mates has already written a whole article dedicated to this course and its faculty. And the reason for that is simple – We learnt the most in this course. This course takes you on a journey of data science where you become fascinated by it. Each one of our classes was focussed on one topic and the number of topics we ended up covering in the entire semester was humongous. If coverage of so much theory wasn’t enough, we also had hands-on sessions in class on R. This was also the only course in ISI in which we did a complete data science project from scratch. You can find the list of projects done by 2016 batch here (and here for 2015 batch). We have spent one month at IIT KGP and we are already seeing the benefits of what we covered in CDS. Having got a glimpse into the multitude of topics earlier, it is now much easier for us to get into the flow of each topic which are being taught in separate courses. 5. Fundamentals of Database Systems : Unless structure follows strategy, inefficiency results. – Alfred D. Chandler This was probably the least thought-out course of the five in this semester. And that worked both ways for us. We finished the stipulated curriculum halfway through the semester and hence the faculty left it unto us what we wanted to cover. Students suggested the topics and were duly obliged. The first half of semester got us acquainted with MySQL. We then studied normalization of databases in detail which talked about how an efficient and accurate database can be designed. We also studied Information Retrieval, MapReduce and Market-basket model in the latter half of semester. In total, we spent exactly 4 months at ISI. That is by no means sufficient amount of time to get the maximum potential out of that place but you make peace with what you get. The learning at ISI was unique at the very least and it provided the perfect kick start we needed in this course. We covered a breadth of topics in a couple of courses and went into depth as well wherever necessary. These courses have laid a solid foundation and now we are in a position to apply these concepts and see if we can really make the data speak. The first and the hardest step has been taken. Now is the time to cover the distance.

There were three interviewers on the panel .I was asked to tell me something about myself and what I want to do next (probably an icebreaker). While I was doing that, they read my CV and asked me about my 3-month internship in Taiwan and the work that I did there. Following that up, they asked me about one other project in depth that I did in Physics. (They didn’t ask me about other projects that were mentioned in the CV which were in relevant fields, like Data structures and another one in Analytics). Then came the part around which majority of the interview revolved. The professor in the middle said ,so you are from IIT Delhi. I should assume you have amazing skills in Mathematics.I said you can say that. The professor sitting on the left asked me about double derivatives, maxima-minima, limits, continuity of 4-5 different functions, each time giving a more complex function and tried to test whether I knew what I was saying and asked me to draw a few functions. But the questions were quite basic and he seemed happy with the answers. *Over to the professor in the middle*. He asked me if my degree had a probability course. I told him that it didn’t but I did a course in Probability and Stochastic processes for extra credits in third year. He asked me to write the probability density function, the cumulative density function of exponential distribution and then draw both of them. When I did that, he asked me what a memoryless process is. I told him that the future state of the process depends on the current state of the process and not the past states . He said that is not the description of a memoryless process. I tried to make him understand in a few different ways but he said no. Then the professor wrote a differential equation that I had never seen in my life. He asked me what it was. I could only answer that it was a linear homogeneous differential equation because beyond that I had no idea. He said it is a linear homogeneous differential equation but what is the name of the equation. I looked at it and tried to remember but in vain. Then he said, it must have been taught to you in the first year. I said it wasn’t taught. He said, it is simply impossible. You need to go back home and look at your notes. I couldn’t argue as it would look bad on my part. *Already sinking in my chair* *Over to the professor on the right* He asked me that you have played basketball on a lot of levels as mentioned in your CV, tell me name of one player. I was relieved that he didn’t ask the size of the court or the ball which I had mugged up the previous night.I said Kobe Bryant. He asked who is the greatest player of all time. I said Michael Jordan. He asked me to name one player playing in NBA who is from India. I answered Satnam Singh. Then he asked me to name one player from team India to which I answered Amritpal Singh and the interview was then over.The written test had more weightage as inspite of not performing very well in interviews, I was selected.

My interview started off with the standard tell me about yourself and my well rehearsed answer.With the unimpressive resume that I had, I couldn’t talk about my work experience or academic excellence. Instead, I spoke at length about my personality traits and aptitude that make me a natural fit for analytics and ended with my motivations for joining PGDBA. Around this time, having gone through my file, one of the interviewers saw that my work experience had not remotely anything to do with analytics or data science and asked my how they tied together. I admitted that they didn’t, that over the years, I had made some decisions and if I could go back and do it all over again, I would not make the same choices and that, I was looking for a second chance. Then they asked me how good I was in Mathematics and if I remembered anything from the course ‘Probability and Random Processes’ I had studied in UG. I said that I was above average and optimistically, good and no, I did not remember, but I had been revising some of the concepts. Then they asked me to solve the puzzle on the white board (It was a 4X4 grid where you had to calculate the number of paths from the lower left corner to the top upper corner). I had already come across that before and told them, and solved it on their insistence upon which I was given further cases on the same grid that I was able to solve. Then, a brief discussion about why I shouldn’t pursue PhD instead of PGDBA ensued (I answered I would, after the course), concluding the interview. The interview time was about 8-10 minutes. Any suggestion for aspirants regarding preparation for written test and interview. Studying and practicing +1, +2 NECRT Mathematics books and solving the previous year question papers would suffice for the written test. About the interviews, they just want to make sure that you are truly interested in the course. Just be honest and explain your motivations for the course.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Maunish Shah December 22, 2015 Reply Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? pgdbaunofficial December 16, 2015 Reply There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. sarthak aggarwal December 29, 2015 Reply sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Mbs January 1, 2016 Reply What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 ankit gupta January 12, 2016 Reply can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Venkatesh January 16, 2016 Reply Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well.

You need to have your +2 level math concepts rock-solid to ace the written exam, and as for VARC and DILR, some CAT type mocks might help since not a lot of content specifically geared towards PGDBA is available yet. DILR is generally very scoring so you should try to get all correct. For interview, be absolutely confident with whatever work you do, and if you’re a fresher, be confident in your undergrad or postgrad course subjects. Try having an idea about how you could incorporate analytics into your work field and why you wanna switch to analytics (if you are switching), and have a concrete understanding of the basics of linear algebra, probability and statistics. And of course, don’t forget the general affairs!

Sitting there all cozy in the 6-9 show of Avenger’s- End Game, the last few moments were surely the emotional roller-coaster. The intense ending of the movie in contrast with the intimation on my selection for the prestigious PGDBA programme made it the quintessential end game. In the amalgamation of a multitude of emotions, there were the elements of concern that made me wonder how the two-year journey would pan out. Having been selected for such a reputed course, I was cognizant of the fact that I would get to meet numerous talents with unparalleled finesse. As today marks the successful one-year completion of my PGDBA journey, I would love to be the raconteur to share an account of my experiences till date. IIMC Bridge Lake IIMC Classroom Mesmerized by the pulchritude of the IIM Calcutta campus, I was all set to traverse the invigorating voyage. In the orientation week, I got acquainted with most of my batch mates and realized the level of diverse expertise each one possessed. It was followed by the ‘ordinary’ classes at IIM, where, every minute seemed like an incessant race against time, all for the quest of managerial acumen. Pre-semester was like a trailer of a fervent flick. In the backdrop of quizzes, case-studies, assignments, and presentations, a funky fresher’s party came like rejuvenation. Organized by our seniors, the soirée provided a platform for showcasing extra-curricular abilities. The parade of variant talents made me acknowledge the multiple prowess, our PGDBA batches owned. With each day that passed by, the hues of pre-sem grew fonder, until the time when it was concluded with a grilling semester exam. Birthdays @ISI CD Deshmukh Bhavan @ISI ISI Farewell Diwali @ISI And in no time, we all were in ISI Kolkata , mecca of Mathematics. The contrast could easily be spotted. Every nook and corner emanated erudite vibes. However, the aura of the institute was pleasant and welcoming. The race here was with knowledge. The devotion and pursuit for learning appeared pristine, which was also shown by the top-notch professors in their readiness to impart wisdom while being compassionate and understanding, enlightening the students in all aspects. With a chunk of peers playing badminton, others peering at them from the top and a few busy with the bulk of assignments, it was at times difficult to decide the activity one really wished to engage in. Apart from juggling between classes and projects, the quest for analytics competence prompted most of us to participate in several Data Science and B-schools competitions, wherein the laudable performances brought laurels to PGDBA. On the social front, be it the magnificence of the Kolkata Durga Puja celebrations, the vigor in Diwali revelry by the entire batch, or just the joy in exploring the city markets, all these would be cherished for life. As the winter winds drew near, the snug yet strenuous ISI semester ended, with a heart-warming farewell and a challenging end-term exam. Main Building @IITKGP Nehru Museum @IITKGP Holi VGSOM Building And soon, with the commencement of the year 2020, we all arrived at the enormous premises of IIT Kharagpur , where the chase was after an efficient time-management. From cycling to the classes to evening strolls to Tech-Market, switching academic buildings between periods to settling into the morning 8 routine while enduring winters, it was quite grueling in essence. In the thick of a bustling semester, the splendor of the Spring Fest, marked by the vibrant live performances and a frolic atmosphere, rolled in like fresh air. This was soon diluted by an enervating mid-semester exam, that seemed boundless. This semester, brimming with tonnes of academic activities, got shadowed, by the swelling plight of the COVID-19 pandemic and as aftermath, it was switched to online mode. As we arrive closer to the completion of this semester, it can be unequivocally opined that this was the most exhausting, yet had its own tunes, to which our rhythms got harmonized. The course is undoubtedly pretty demanding, which sometimes makes you question the worth of all the efforts. But, in the midst of an ongoing semester, when you find the beaming faces and satisfied souls of seniors after securing tremendous placements, where the giants across the country were hell-bent on hiring in a bunch, you realize the influence the power of the triumvirate, the structure of the course and your efforts can create. In a nutshell, the journey so far has been enveloped in vivacity with enlightenment, camaraderie, and a rich set of cultures from all the three institutes, at its very core! — Sugandha Ranjan Post navigation Next Article The mission of PGDBA Previous Article PGDBA Interview Experiences – 2020-22 Related Articles Articles The mission of PGDBA By Anurag Malakar, PGDBA Batch-5 (2019-21) The year 2005 | A regular morning in a middle-class Indian’s life The middle-aged… General FAQs Please go through the official website for the program to answer your basic queries: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/programs/pgdba 1) How do I apply… About Us What is PGDBA? “Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.” -… Articles Wiser By A Semester Of Statistics - Himanshu Goyal The first step is the hardest. - Unknown When one first hears about the PGDBA course, the… This Article Has 3 Comments Madhur Modi June 18, 2020 Reply Truly mesmerizing Shreshth Bhatt July 12, 2020 Reply Ma’am its such a wonderful and an enjoyable experiences you and your fellow mates had …and you really have described it so aptly… Shivam Singh July 27, 2020 Reply I was pretty shy to ask for help regarding this course but after reading this I so want to Can you help me out ?

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

The classes were held initially at the Kolmogorov bhavan. Within a month we were given our own classroom in the Satyendra Nath Bose Bhavan. Kolmogorov bhavan, ISI Our curriculum consisted of 5 subjects. The subjects and the professors involved were: Statistical inference – Amitava Banerjee Stochastic processes – Dr. Bimal Roy & Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta Computing for data sciences – Dr. Sourav Sengupta Statistical structures in data – Debashish Sengupta Database Management Systems – Dr. Pinakpani Pal & Amiya Das By far the stars of the course were the faculty members. It was an honour to interact with a Padma Shree awardee in Dr. Bimal Roy. To be taught on a regular basis by such an esteemed personality was slightly overwhelming and hugely enriching. The sheer brilliance of the man and his way of looking at probability and its applications was an experience difficult to pen down. Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta shared the course and taught Markov Chains. Satyendra Nath bhavan , ISI Campus Diligent and sincere, Prof. Debashish Sengupta was the ideal teacher. He covered every topic rigorously starting right with the basics of statistics to the highly complex multivariate analysis. What seemed an easy course initially, became heavily loaded and among the toughest by the time the course came to its completion. Tutorials were held every week to discuss exercise problems. The jovial Prof. Amitava Banerjee taught us the habit of drawing meaningful inferences out of large volumes of data. Drawing from his vast pool of consultancy experience, he inculcated in us the ability to convert real life business problems into statistical problems. His assignments involved working on datasets and testing hypothesis in the correct way. Dr. Pinakpani Pal was interactive, and worked hard to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. His course had 2 parts: the theoretical knowledge of databases, and a hands-on SQL application. He shared the course with Amiya Das, a seasoned professional at Oracle. The friendly and ever enthusiastic Dr Sourav Sengupta was always approachable and motivated the entire batch in getting accustomed with highly complex ideas. His passion for teaching shone through as he went through the concepts of linear algebra and machine learning algorithms. He organised the course superbly and the web page for his course was among the best resource repositories we could have hoped for. The invited lectures were top drawer, with experienced professionals coming in to share their insights and recommendations about the field of analytics. Overall the first semester was a learning experience beyond compare and laid a solid foundation on which we can build in our journey towards becoming well-rounded data scientists.

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Reply Venkatesh says: January 16, 2016 at 9:17 am Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:36 am For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well. Reply Hardik Agarwal says: March 27, 2016 at 12:44 pm URGENT : If I don’t have an important document that has to be shown during the interview process in original (as said in the call letter), can I show its copy and give an undertaking of that? Will it work or will they cancel my candidature? Thanks in advance. Reply Madhur Modi says: April 20, 2016 at 10:04 am The interviews are already over. I think you would have already received the instructions from the panel about this Reply subhodeep says: April 19, 2016 at 10:28 am hi, i converted my PGDBA call. i am looking forward to join this course and very optimistic about it. just need to convince myself that avg salary will be equivalent to PGDM of IIMC. how is the industry perceiving this course. are companies like BCG and MCG lined up for PGDBA? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:00 pm Hi.. did you join the course?? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:01 pm What was last year’s cut-off to get the admissions?

Madhur Modi It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds. Here’s a showcase of their profiles: Alok Mani Singh The civil engineer from BHEL, and the “stud” with 4-year worth of experience from a Maharatna PSU and IIT Guwahati attached in his name was the first person who secured his foreign intern in the prestigious Dunia Finance in Dubai. The “Perfect Statistician” as well as the “Management expert” who can solve any problem that comes his way “within a night or two”. He also likes to play guitar and has entertained us for past one and a half years with his pleasant voice. Now he will be working closely with the head of strategic analytics function at Dunia during his 6-month internship in Dubai. Siddhant Sanjeev “Coder” as everyone in the batch knows him to be, was the only other person to impress the company Dunia and accompany Alok to Dubai. Everyone in the batch knows him as a fresher with computer science background from NSIT and a national level coder. He also got himself an interview offer from Google owing to his coding skills as well as won case competitions from PwC and Deloitte. He also developed an e-commerce website using intricate concepts of natural language processing, recommendation systems and information retrieval. Ankitkumar Sonthalia Better known as “Sonthu”, this guy has 3 years of work experience from Cognizant and now he is going to work for Rocket Internet in Myanmar. He has worked on marketing strategy, predictions and recommendation systems. He is a travel enthusiast and has organized many unforgettable trips for our batch. He has also conducted cricket fantasy league and freshers’ party. Rachit Tripathi A mechanical engineer from IIT Kanpur by mind and a quant trader by heart, Rachit bagged an internship in France at QuantCube Technology, a niche fintech company. He’s also part of the team selected for data science game, an international inter-university competition held in Paris. In his pursuit of becoming a quant trader, he obtained CFA level 1 certification and solved various cases from those on Walmart to those on Yahoo data. He is also known as the “data scientist” of the batch and has recently been selected as one of the finalists in Goldman Sachs Quantify competition. Avinash Kumar He is a mechanical engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has worked in L&T for 3 years. He was offered an internship at Rocket Internet which he did not take as he aspired to work in India. He has written an international research paper and also has been part of the Data Science Game with Rachit during this course. He also won NASA systems engineering award while being a B.Tech. student. Besides, he is also a skilled TT player as well as a chess enthusiast. Bharathi Ramaraj Bharathi got the internship offer from Rocket Internet but she decided to stay in India. The only girl to get a foreign internship offer, she is a fresher with B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering. She has worked on uplift modeling, high-frequency data and news analytics and has taken part in various Kaggle competitions. She is also an international chess player and has traveled to as many as 16 countries representing India. She envisions being a financial analyst and to use advanced analytics techniques in a financial credit company to build her career. Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world. Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics.

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand. Tags Analytics , Data Sciences , Healthcare Analytics , PGDBA Categories Articles Technical A Record, a Code and Twitter Post author By pgdba_admin Post date January 20, 2016 3 Comments on A Record, a Code and Twitter How my first machine learning model was validated by a goal scored a continent away. Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program. Tags Analytics , PGDBA , placements , students Categories About Us What is PGDBA? Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day.

While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Maunish Shah December 22, 2015 Reply Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? pgdbaunofficial December 16, 2015 Reply There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. sarthak aggarwal December 29, 2015 Reply sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Madhur Modi January 18, 2016 Reply There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Mbs January 1, 2016 Reply What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 ankit gupta January 12, 2016 Reply can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material?

As per a McKinsey report, big data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function the same way as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition. The increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media and the Internet of Things will fuel exponential growth in data in the foreseeable future. The rapid pace with which data is being generated across various domains and fields would require people with deep analytical skills to provide insights, enabling companies to gain a competitive edge and offer a better consumer experience. The insights from the data are used for various purposes such as segmentation of customers for better targeting, prediction of churn rate, product recommendation, analysis of customer opinion from media posts, preventive maintenance, management of portfolio risk etc. Untapped potential in India In India, the analytics market is expected to double between 2013 and 2018, reaching a figure of US$ 2.3 billion by 2018, according to a report published by NASSCOM and Blueocean Market Intelligence. This will result in a shortage of about 200,000 data scientists in India over the next few years, according to sources in the Analytics Special Interest Group setup by NASSCOM. Hence, creation of trained industry-ready business analytics professionals is the need of the day. Globally, the demand of data scientists is projected to exceed supply by more than 50% by 2018. To address the paucity of trained workforce in analytics domain, the onus is on the educational institutes to address the needs of the industry. The three institutes IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata are aware of the demand for the well rounded analytics professionals. In order to understand the needs of the industry, a day long conclave was held in January 2015 in IIM Calcutta. Representatives of the leading companies such as KPMG, EXL, Deloitte, LatentView, TCS, Reliance Communication, Deutsche Bank, E&Y, SBI, IBM, Google, Microsoft, HSBC and Cognizant took part in the conclave and based on their inputs, ideas of a specialized course emerged, a course which would produce leaders of the future, skilled in the essential areas of business, statistics and computer science. Through this collaboration between industry and academia, PGDBA was born. Introduction to PGDBA PGDBA is a two year full time residential diploma programme aimed at creating business analytics professionals employable by leading Indian and foreign firms. This programme is designed for those who have an analytical mindset, are interested in tackling challenging business problems, and possess an inclination towards Mathematics. Some of the salient features of the programme include courses taught by reputed faculty members at the campuses of three globally renowned institutes, hands-on business analytics training at a related company, continuous interaction with industry leaders throughout the duration of the programme and the availability of placement opportunities at all the three institutes. The three institutes complement each other to give students the most comprehensive learning of business analytics. The course finds the optimal balance between the theoretical concepts of data science and their applications to business problems. Students get to regularly interact with industry experts through invited talks and guest lectures, where experts talk about the latest trends and challenges in the industry. The course leverages the best of the three institutes in their respective fields of expertise, i.e., Statistics, Technology and Business. In the first semester at ISI, students form a strong base of Mathematical and Statistical concepts. This is followed by a semester at IIT Kharagpur, where students work on data science projects and get to test their statistical concepts built at ISI. This semester is meant to build students’ technical expertise. To complement the first two semesters, students spend their third semester at IIM Calcutta where they are exposed to business problems through case studies and industry interactions. To cap it all, the students get to implement their knowledge in the industry through a six months long internship as their fourth semester. Placements The students from the first two batches of PGDBA experienced highly successful placement processes. Companies from various industries such as BFSI, Consulting, Healthcare, Research, Retail, Gaming, Technology etc. participated and handpicked candidates suitable for both data-driven and business driven analyst roles. The placement processes witnessed the involvement of Fortune 500 companies such as American Express, Walmart Labs, UnitedHealth Group, JPMC, Amazon, Walmart Labs. Some of the job profiles offered were Senior Data Scientist, Analytics Manager, Statistical Analyst, Lead Business Analyst, Solution Analyst, Experienced Associate, Assistant Project Manager. With continuously increasing demand of business analytics professionals, the future of PGDBA looks promising. The unique opportunity of learning from three top-notch institutes of the country is unparalleled by any other Data Analytics course. Recently, PGDBA was ranked 1 by the Analytics India Magazine among the data science courses offered in the country. Stay tuned for more updates Follow us on Facebook Categories Articles Experiences General The Journey of Identities Post author By pgdba_admin Post date August 14, 2016 No Comments on The Journey of Identities To all those who just joined in. And to all those who couldn’t. I’ve jumped ships. I’ve made the leap. I am now a part of what they call Tata Hall- the luxurious guesthouse at IIM C, when I used to be a part of what they called Himadri (my IIT Delhi hostel). I am convinced that recording my first impressions of this maddening, surreal odyssey that I have set out on will not only prove to be fruitful in retrospect, but in fact help me in retaining my sanity in the present. For those of you who have been wondering what I’m going to blabber about, I would like to give you some context before you abandon me. I am now a student at the PGDBA program. I am comfortably living in my posh suite of the guesthouse of IIM C, with my amazing roommate, situated in Joka, which is nearly thirty kilometers away from the city of Kolkata. There are one hundred and three other students in this program who live with me, so I am sometimes tempted to forget that we are literally in the middle of nowhere. We are being fed an illusion – but an irresistible one that I don’t have the heart to snap out of. In some ways, the fact that the city is beyond my reach is liberating. The five years I spent living in the heart of Delhi, and then another two years in the legendary city of Mumbai, I craved for an escape, for a way out. I think this program has finally answered my call for help. Here, I am constantly told that I am special, that I am the chosen one. The twenty-four years of my life that have led to this moment have made me so cynical that I doubt their belief in me. But at the same time, I greatly value it. After a very long time, I am around people who are willing to invest in my future simply because the three accomplished panel members saw a spark in me, during the twenty-five minutes I spent interviewing for the program. I feel humbled and terrified. The two years ahead are going to demand every inch of me, it is going to consume me, and it is going to change me. But for so long I have felt nothing, that this rush, this constant buzz in my head, this restlessness feels good. I am sleep-deprived, surviving on n number of cups of terribly made tea and coffee and hopping from one assignment to the other with some extended breaks thankfully, and yet, I am alive. How often is it that you are so committed to the moment that every other structure inside and outside your mind breaks form, and this particular moment is all that you can see, all that you can register? This program is one such moment in my life. The program, which aims at producing a team of unparalleled business analysts and data scientists, supposedly the sexiest job in the market these days, has been ideated by the three premiere institutes of India – Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This very credibility generates the “Pygmalion effect” and drives me to excel in the area of analytics. The coming two years make me realize, that I’m far away from the comfort zone and stability that life had offered just before I decided to enroll into PGDBA. But I am also glad that it happened, for I can now appreciate the morning for what it truly represents – a fresh start. I like the concept of this new beginning, for it brings with it the exciting journey of exploring new dimensions and reconstruct your identity. I am tempted to fantasize about the future, but I am trying to contain my excitement to the moment. So many paths seem to call out to me that my brain will explode if I start to think too much. What do I want, you ask? Organized chaos. If you think that is romantically abstract, then you have understood me just a little more than you did before you began to read this note. I will end with a few lines that so perfectly describe my state of mind right now, that I might just marry Robert Frost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. Categories General Prospects of PGDBA – The Million Dollar Question Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 4, 2015 14 Comments on Prospects of PGDBA – The Million Dollar Question One of the most common questions that we have come across in the past few days is – How would placements/internships be? Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

It seems a bit confusing at the start but soon one gets fascinated by it. The fact that each aspect of business analytics is taught by a specialized institute seems like a perfect horses-for-courses strategy. When I first heard about it, there was one name out of the three which captured my imagination the most and made me take this course seriously. That was ISI Kolkata – the pinnacle for statisticians. It is not to say that IIT Kharagpur and IIM Calcutta are insignificant names – popularity-wise that would be opposite – but the fact that an institute which is known more for its research-oriented approach, and not for focussing on fat pay checks, was a part of this curriculum made me think that I might actually learn something in this course and not just bide my time until the placement season. Hence I can say that ISI is one of the primary reasons for me being in this course. Now that the ISI phase is over I feel it imperative to share my experience. Due to space constraints, I will limit this article to my academic experience and not the student life there. We studied 5 courses there and though I will not be able to do justice to each of them in this short space, I will try my best to give an overview of what we studied in each course. 1. Stochastic Processes and its Applications : Randomness is the true foundation of mathematics. – Gregory Chaitin This course can be thought of as 3-in-1. It started with probability problems (check out gambler’s ruin problem if gambling is your thing), their ingenious solutions and then expanded to probability distributions. In almost no time at all, we shifted gears from simple coin tosses to complex problems involving combinations of probability and calculus. When we got done with it all in one month, we found out that it was a precursor to stochastic processes. We then spent a good amount of time studying Markov chains which has innumerable practical applications in today’s world (Google’s PageRank algorithm). If that was not enough in one semester, we also got an introduction to time series forecasting in final stages of the course. Probability, Stochastic Processes and Time Series forecasting – All three have the potential to be a separate course in themselves for one whole semester. While we couldn’t cover each one of them extensively, the course was a good starting point for someone looking for further studies in this area. It also covered enough of the three sub-topics so that we wouldn’t be sitting ducks when facing practical problems in this subject. 2. Statistical Structures in Data : Statistics is the grammar of science. – Karl Pearson Arguably the most important course of the semester. This course dwelled into pure statistics which started from simple properties of a distribution such as mean, median, variance, etc. We then moved to solve regression problems which started from univariate and culminated in multivariate statistics. This course also introduced us to various concepts in machine learning such as PCA, Factor Analysis, GLM and Decision Trees. Don’t worry if all these terms look Chinese to you, many of us weren’t aware of it either before stepping into ISI. Going by the internship interview experience of the first batch of PGDBA, it was considered to be the most important course. I believe that is because being a data analyst is not about being able to run a code in a software, rather it is about understanding the concepts behind the scenes and use that to extract maximum information. This course does exactly that. 3. Inferences: It is a hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow; and this means that we do not know whether it will rise. – Ludwig Wittgenstein English is never going to be the same for you once you attend this course. This course gave a glimpse into how technical can one get into statistics. We found that many things which would seem a mere nuisance to a ‘normal’ person actually have a lot of difference when it comes to statistics. Likelihood and Probability take on a new meaning altogether; Parameter, Statistic, Estimator and Estimate will always seem like a case of so-near-yet-so-far. We also covered the concept of hypothesis testing and its applications. Any statistics-101 book will have these topics and this particular course coupled with the one above forms the crux for which one comes to ISI. It is quite easy to commit mistakes in statistics by missing out on one or two seemingly trivial assumptions. This course taught us to be really careful with what we state and what we assume. At the same time, it taught us concepts which have direct applications in the real world and in the realm of statistics. 4. Computing for Data Sciences (CDS) : Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid; humans are slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are powerful beyond imagination. – Leo Cherne (This quote is often wrongly attributed to Einstein) One of my batch-mates has already written a whole article dedicated to this course and its faculty. And the reason for that is simple – We learnt the most in this course. This course takes you on a journey of data science where you become fascinated by it. Each one of our classes was focussed on one topic and the number of topics we ended up covering in the entire semester was humongous. If coverage of so much theory wasn’t enough, we also had hands-on sessions in class on R. This was also the only course in ISI in which we did a complete data science project from scratch. You can find the list of projects done by 2016 batch here (and here for 2015 batch). We have spent one month at IIT KGP and we are already seeing the benefits of what we covered in CDS. Having got a glimpse into the multitude of topics earlier, it is now much easier for us to get into the flow of each topic which are being taught in separate courses. 5. Fundamentals of Database Systems : Unless structure follows strategy, inefficiency results. – Alfred D. Chandler This was probably the least thought-out course of the five in this semester. And that worked both ways for us. We finished the stipulated curriculum halfway through the semester and hence the faculty left it unto us what we wanted to cover. Students suggested the topics and were duly obliged. The first half of semester got us acquainted with MySQL. We then studied normalization of databases in detail which talked about how an efficient and accurate database can be designed. We also studied Information Retrieval, MapReduce and Market-basket model in the latter half of semester. In total, we spent exactly 4 months at ISI. That is by no means sufficient amount of time to get the maximum potential out of that place but you make peace with what you get. The learning at ISI was unique at the very least and it provided the perfect kick start we needed in this course. We covered a breadth of topics in a couple of courses and went into depth as well wherever necessary. These courses have laid a solid foundation and now we are in a position to apply these concepts and see if we can really make the data speak. The first and the hardest step has been taken. Now is the time to cover the distance.

When you tell them that you’ve made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, “What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. -The Little Prince Our first exams in this first semester at ISI have finally arrived. One of the subjects of the course, and of the more interesting ones I might add, is ‘Probability and Stochastic Processes’. This was also the subject of our first exam. I have been pouring over notes and hundreds of pages of text in preparation of this exam. The intricacies in some of the ideas reminded me of these lines taken from ‘The Little Prince’ and quoted by David Freedman in his book on Statistics. Are such matters as figures and charts always dry and boring? In our first class, the professor of the same subject also remarked, “Maybe our insistence on numbers is the limitation of man”. ‘The Little Prince’ is a famous classic written by Saint Antoine du Exupery. Although it was first written as a children’s book, it has been enjoyed over the years by adults alike as a heart-warming story on friendship, growing-up and the curious fascinations of man. One of the oft used coinages in the book is the phrase ‘matters of consequence’. The Little Prince finds, at one point, a man aimlessly counting stars to the extent that he reaches ‘five hundred and one million’. This man then ironically refers to his counting as a matter of consequence. In these days leading up to our exams, I began to wonder whether factuality could be made interesting in the context of some intricacies I came across in problems of Probability Theory. Are there questions that I can ask that are not as dry as the character’s occupation of counting in The Little Prince? Consider the following questions. How many random people would I need to collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that at least two of them share their birthdays? The answer to this is a surprisingly low number. Let’s look at a different question. How many people would I need to catch hold of and ask birthdays of to have half a chance of finding someone who shares my birthday? It is also interesting to note that this number is different from the first one. Louis CK, the famous stand-up comedian, made an interesting remark in one of his live shows. He said that there were enough people attending his show for there to be a fair chance that a few of them would die in the coming year. Ouch! Let’s pose that as a question on chance. Assume a population with a certain death rate. What is the number of people I would have to randomly collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that someone would die tomorrow? Enough with birthdays and death days. Consider coin tosses. Say, I keep tossing a coin and keep getting heads for a hundred tosses. I only know that it is equally likely that my coin is anything between a perfectly rigged coin to a perfectly fair coin. What is the chance that I win if I bet on the next toss to be heads? Let’s stretch this slightly further. Let us assume that when the universe was born, the probability that the sun would rise over planet earth each day was made to depend on a coin toss. We only know that this coin was likely to be anything between a perfectly fair to a perfectly unfair coin (God is playing a cruel game). What is the probability that the sun would rise tomorrow, given that it has been rising each day over all these years since the birth of the universe? Let’s give some rest to our poor coin and move on to other questions. The Monty Hall Problem is a famous example on how sometimes the idea of chance can stump intuition. Here’s a different example in a similar vein. Suppose there are three suspects in jail who have been cleared of any wrongdoing and are all going to be released soon. It is announced that two of the three would be released the next day but these three don’t know exactly which two of them will be released. One of them decides to go ask the guard which one of the other two prisoners is going to be released. But then he thinks the following to himself, “After I have asked, I have only a one in two chance that I’m the second guy to be released. But before I ask, there is a two in three chance that I will be one of the guys to be released. So should I rather not ask?” Like one of our professors quips so often, ‘Remember that there’s a chance model somewhere in the background.’ Somebody somewhere is flipping a coin. Maybe someday a story will be written on a travelling mathematician who visits magical planets to ask questions on chances of consequence. It’s a long shot that it would be anything as beautiful as the masterpiece that is the ‘The Little Prince’. But I wager it wouldn’t be as bad as dry pointless counting. ← Joka Library to Paris – A Data Science Crusade → Foreign Internships: Ambassadors of PGDBA Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta ; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur . PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

Madhur Modi It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds. Here’s a showcase of their profiles: Alok Mani Singh The civil engineer from BHEL, and the “stud” with 4-year worth of experience from a Maharatna PSU and IIT Guwahati attached in his name was the first person who secured his foreign intern in the prestigious Dunia Finance in Dubai. The “Perfect Statistician” as well as the “Management expert” who can solve any problem that comes his way “within a night or two”. He also likes to play guitar and has entertained us for past one and a half years with his pleasant voice. Now he will be working closely with the head of strategic analytics function at Dunia during his 6-month internship in Dubai. Siddhant Sanjeev “Coder” as everyone in the batch knows him to be, was the only other person to impress the company Dunia and accompany Alok to Dubai. Everyone in the batch knows him as a fresher with computer science background from NSIT and a national level coder. He also got himself an interview offer from Google owing to his coding skills as well as won case competitions from PwC and Deloitte. He also developed an e-commerce website using intricate concepts of natural language processing, recommendation systems and information retrieval. Ankitkumar Sonthalia Better known as “Sonthu”, this guy has 3 years of work experience from Cognizant and now he is going to work for Rocket Internet in Myanmar. He has worked on marketing strategy, predictions and recommendation systems. He is a travel enthusiast and has organized many unforgettable trips for our batch. He has also conducted cricket fantasy league and freshers’ party. Rachit Tripathi A mechanical engineer from IIT Kanpur by mind and a quant trader by heart, Rachit bagged an internship in France at QuantCube Technology, a niche fintech company. He’s also part of the team selected for data science game, an international inter-university competition held in Paris. In his pursuit of becoming a quant trader, he obtained CFA level 1 certification and solved various cases from those on Walmart to those on Yahoo data. He is also known as the “data scientist” of the batch and has recently been selected as one of the finalists in Goldman Sachs Quantify competition. Avinash Kumar He is a mechanical engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has worked in L&T for 3 years. He was offered an internship at Rocket Internet which he did not take as he aspired to work in India. He has written an international research paper and also has been part of the Data Science Game with Rachit during this course. He also won NASA systems engineering award while being a B.Tech. student. Besides, he is also a skilled TT player as well as a chess enthusiast. Bharathi Ramaraj Bharathi got the internship offer from Rocket Internet but she decided to stay in India. The only girl to get a foreign internship offer, she is a fresher with B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering. She has worked on uplift modeling, high-frequency data and news analytics and has taken part in various Kaggle competitions. She is also an international chess player and has traveled to as many as 16 countries representing India. She envisions being a financial analyst and to use advanced analytics techniques in a financial credit company to build her career. Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world. Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics. ← Chances of Consequence → What is PGDBA?

No General Interview Questions based on your work experience and profile 1. What are your roles and responsibility in current job? 2. How many bytes in 1 GB and in 1 TB? 3. What are the possible outcomes in binary system and some more basic questions about binary system (However, this binary thing came into discussion out of nowhere). Mathematics and Statistics related interview questions 1. Prof 1 asked me to go to white board and gave one typical TSD problem and asked to find out the answer to the problem. I answered the question using short trick, but he asked to use the orthodox method to get to the answer and asked me to speak out loud my thoughts while solving. 2. All the three Profs Grilled a lot on Normal distribution curve and questions by modifying the curve a little. 3. What is the area of Normal distribution curve? 4. What are the notations that we use to describe any Normal distribution curve? 5. Made multiple ND curves and asked me to compare the areas of all of them? 6. Some questions about Mean and std deviation related to ND curve. Coding / ML related Interview questions No coding related questions GK and Current Affairs based questions 1. Female Prof asked about my home city Varanasi and its specialty. 2. What all places near Varanasi are there that you will suggest me to explore? 3. Is there any art museum in Varanasi? (Answered: Yes) 4. Where is it situated, and have you ever been there? Any other questions asked based on Logical Reasoning, puzzles None Rate the Interview difficulty on the scale of 1 to 5 5 Rate the written exam difficulty on the scale of 1 to 5 4 Did you receive any offers from alternate programs (MBA, MS, MTech, PhD, others)? If yes, please specify the details. Converted all the CAP IIMs. Due to low percentile in DILR could not make it to Old IIMs. Cleared Written of ISI MSQMS program. Waitlisted in IIFT (still in progress) Tips for Interview Do not believe on the advice that just the basics of 11th – 12th math is enough for this exam.

Capitalise on the common types and practice a few tough ones as well since cutoff will go extremely high due to competition. I would recommend practising mocks as well as completing the whole syllabus for the exam. 2. interview: Anything goes tbh. You cannot predict the 15 mins allocated to you. Be Confident and get your interview fundamentals right. Fundamentals include: Tell Me About Yourself Why PGDBA Work ex (if your work ex is in analytics expect heavy questioning here, your interview most likely will run here if you have a analytics background.) Future Prospects Strengths and Weaknesses After Fundamentals get to puzzle solving from Geeks for Geeks, again here is only a few handfuls of patterns available just understand the fundamental logic. Finally, learn linear regression (in-depth) and revise graduation math. Apart from technical aspects, try to complete all the news videos from StudyIQ from January to the Date of your interview in descending order i.e. first complete the current month’s news and slowly if time permits work your way towards the old news.

My preparation also focused on these areas, and I even tried to steer the interview towards math through my intro. However, they asked me mechanical engineering questions instead. If you have a basic understanding of your field, you’ll be able to handle those questions as well.

Sitting there all cozy in the 6-9 show of Avenger’s- End Game, the last few moments were surely the emotional roller-coaster. The intense ending of the movie in contrast with the intimation on my selection for the prestigious PGDBA programme made it the quintessential end game. In the amalgamation of a multitude of emotions, there were the elements of concern that made me wonder how the two-year journey would pan out. Having been selected for such a reputed course, I was cognizant of the fact that I would get to meet numerous talents with unparalleled finesse. As today marks the successful one-year completion of my PGDBA journey, I would love to be the raconteur to share an account of my experiences till date. IIMC Bridge Lake IIMC Classroom Mesmerized by the pulchritude of the IIM Calcutta campus, I was all set to traverse the invigorating voyage. In the orientation week, I got acquainted with most of my batch mates and realized the level of diverse expertise each one possessed. It was followed by the ‘ordinary’ classes at IIM, where, every minute seemed like an incessant race against time, all for the quest of managerial acumen. Pre-semester was like a trailer of a fervent flick. In the backdrop of quizzes, case-studies, assignments, and presentations, a funky fresher’s party came like rejuvenation. Organized by our seniors, the soirée provided a platform for showcasing extra-curricular abilities. The parade of variant talents made me acknowledge the multiple prowess, our PGDBA batches owned. With each day that passed by, the hues of pre-sem grew fonder, until the time when it was concluded with a grilling semester exam. CD Deshmukh Bhavan @ISI ISI Farewell Birthdays @ISI Diwali @ISI And in no time, we all were in ISI Kolkata , mecca of Mathematics. The contrast could easily be spotted. Every nook and corner emanated erudite vibes. However, the aura of the institute was pleasant and welcoming. The race here was with knowledge. The devotion and pursuit for learning appeared pristine, which was also shown by the top-notch professors in their readiness to impart wisdom while being compassionate and understanding, enlightening the students in all aspects. With a chunk of peers playing badminton, others peering at them from the top and a few busy with the bulk of assignments, it was at times difficult to decide the activity one really wished to engage in. Apart from juggling between classes and projects, the quest for analytics competence prompted most of us to participate in several Data Science and B-schools competitions, wherein the laudable performances brought laurels to PGDBA. On the social front, be it the magnificence of the Kolkata Durga Puja celebrations, the vigor in Diwali revelry by the entire batch, or just the joy in exploring the city markets, all these would be cherished for life. As the winter winds drew near, the snug yet strenuous ISI semester ended, with a heart-warming farewell and a challenging end-term exam. Main Building @IITKGP Nehru Museum @IITKGP Holi VGSOM Building And soon, with the commencement of the year 2020, we all arrived at the enormous premises of IIT Kharagpur , where the chase was after an efficient time-management. From cycling to the classes to evening strolls to Tech-Market, switching academic buildings between periods to settling into the morning 8 routine while enduring winters, it was quite grueling in essence. In the thick of a bustling semester, the splendor of the Spring Fest, marked by the vibrant live performances and a frolic atmosphere, rolled in like fresh air. This was soon diluted by an enervating mid-semester exam, that seemed boundless. This semester, brimming with tonnes of academic activities, got shadowed, by the swelling plight of the COVID-19 pandemic and as aftermath, it was switched to online mode. As we arrive closer to the completion of this semester, it can be unequivocally opined that this was the most exhausting, yet had its own tunes, to which our rhythms got harmonized. The course is undoubtedly pretty demanding, which sometimes makes you question the worth of all the efforts. But, in the midst of an ongoing semester, when you find the beaming faces and satisfied souls of seniors after securing tremendous placements, where the giants across the country were hell-bent on hiring in a bunch, you realize the influence the power of the triumvirate, the structure of the course and your efforts can create.

Himanshu Goyal About the author: B. Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering from IIT Delhi – worked in Global Analytics (short-term loan provider in UK) for 5 years within collection analytics and risk analytics teams. There have been a lot of posts around the vision and scope of the program so I am not going to touch upon that for now. Instead, I am going to share my first-hand experience of the events in the first week – the orientation week – and how they affected my perception. Whenever we meet a stranger, we need an icebreaker to get things started. And that was the way the orientation week was designed. If there is one thing that repeatedly gets focussed on here at IIM-C, it is that you need to build your network. I had a fair deal of interactions with various groups. There were sessions with Deans, Program Founders, Professors, Seniors and last but not the least, multiple industry leaders. The sessions were designed to make the students more aware of the program, in terms of what the students should expect from it as well as what the professors and industries expected from its graduates. Not only did these sessions made me more informed, but I also learnt a few concepts in this week itself before the classes had even started! Interaction with Professors : There were multiple types of interactions with professors. In one of them, Deans and Senior Professors of the three institutes talked about the genesis of the program and how the geography of the three institutes fitted in perfectly to start it. It was heart-warming to see how each of them would compliment each other’s institution when their own was one of the best in its field. In another session, professors of the Organisational Behaviour course conducted a class exercise – Lost@C. While I won’t go into what it was, it would suffice to say that it was not only fun, but it also made me think on how to work better as a team. A session on how to solve case studies was organised as well. It was a very interactive session and I was encouraged to think and ask questions. All said and done, that my next 2 years were in the hands of capable professors. Interaction with Seniors : This was something each one of my batch was looking forward to. All of us had come from different backgrounds and we had questions – a significant number of them. The interaction started with introductions from both the batches. It then shifted to academic structure, the life at different campuses and the opportunities in the industry. There were a bunch of fundas from their end out of which I don’t remember much; but the key takeaway for me was that there is a huge demand in the industry for people having the right blend of technical skills and business acumen and this course perfectly bridges that gap. A large number of people have their eyes on how first few batches are performing and hence it will be up to us on how much we can push ourselves because the opportunity to gain knowledge in the three institutes is endless. Interaction with Industries : Companies were indeed looking forward to interact which was evident in the first week itself. Among them were – LatentView, PWC, KPMG, Deloitte and few others. What was striking to see was that despite belonging to diverse backgrounds, all of them had same expectations – the graduates from this course will be able to solve crucial business problems using data which will be analysed through various machine learning processes. Each of the companies highlighted the need for data scientists in today’s world because of the amount of data being generated and how it can be filled with us if we have the right mindset. It was also heartening to know that machine learning was now being applied to almost every domain (even agriculture); one just has to have an inquisitive mind to ask the right questions. I clearly remember a quote from one of such sessions, “Size of data is not the thing, but what you do with it.” Orientation day @ISI: As part of the orientation program, we also spent one day at ISI Kolkata and interacted with the professors there. At first look, ISI is an unassuming college (specially after going from IIM which has 7 lakes inside its campus!!). However, it is second to none when it comes to the faculty. One can easily find that each of the faculty is a gem by going through their profile and I cannot possible complete this article without mentioning Prof. Bimal Roy – A Padma Shri awardee, Master Cryptologist, Ex-Director at ISI – it can go on and on. He took a brief session and shared his personal experiences related to analytics. His way of telling stories really connected with me. He added a new dimension of problem solving techniques in my mind in that short session itself. . I already knew that ISI was going to play a unique role in this program because of its unparalleled specialisation in statistics and the one day spent there made me even more excited to start my studies. Given that the program is in its development stage, I had made a conscious choice and took a leap of faith while deciding to join the course. I had belief in the system, but was still apprehensive about industry expectations, and how will the institutes coordinate among themselves. These interactions, in one way or another, not only helped in soothing down my nerves but also made me even more excited and motivated to do well and make this program a success. As Abraham Lincoln once said, The best way to predict your future is to create it .

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

And the first thing that followed was why I wanted to pursue Analytics, being a chess player. I said, I wanted to make an impact, also decision making plays a big role in analytics thus being a chess player gives me the apt mindset in the field. I gave real-life examples where I used chess playing skills and also highlighted my enthusiasm towards chess by describing how I view situations as a chessboard and how I involve members as pieces playing the game. The panelists gave me new situations to test my viewpoint by letting me turn the interview into a game of chess where the panelists and I were pieces on the board. I took up the problem and described various strategies that I had at my disposal. I spoke at length about the best strategy that I would deploy to win the game. They also asked about the factors which led me to pursue analytics like my placement in an analytics company and why I wanted to complete postgraduate studies. To this I replied, doing it now would help me save time and gain an early advantage which will be very valuable in the long run. My interview was relatively short compared to other candidates.” ****** Shashank Kumar -B.Tech in EEE , 2.5+ years of experience in VLSI design “I was the first person to be interviewed at my center. The conversation started with current affairs and the morning news. The analytics projects during my engineering were heavily focused upon. Technical questions included topics like probability, regression, various types of regression and analysis of the quality of fit based on residual plots. The interview spanned around 15 minutes. In hindsight, I think it was a pretty short interview” ****** Sajal Jain – Class representative (PGDBA 2015-2017),B.Tech in Civil Engineering with 4 years of experience in software industry “My interview wasn’t strictly a technical one. The few questions included questions on differentiability and continuity and other basic mathematical concepts. My interview majorly focused on how, in my view, my background of civil engineer with more than 4 years of experience in software industry would indulge in a career in analytics and add a different value and perspectives to the batch. The questions were not at all tough so I would advise the candidates to be firm in their basics” ****** Ayan Sengupta , a fresher who has done BSc and MSc in mathematics and computing “Having a background different from most of the other candidates, my interview was naturally quite unique in its own way. I expected a tough line of questioning from the panelists but my interview consisted of aptitude questions such as how I would find a method for the CEO of the company I work in to cross a river given that he doesn’t know swimming. There were also other puzzles such as – Why manholes are round and simple mathematical questions covering number theory . The interview was around 20-25 minutes long.” ****** Shoorvir Gupta , a fresher in mechanical engineering and an IES aspirant “My interview started with the description of my college and grades. I mentioned my college life and how I became inclined towards gaming, had all A’s in technical subjects, very high CAT score and a 10 pointer in internship. The rest of the interview was focused on IES and related questions to various fields in IES, questions on strength of material and on boilers and its parts (mechanical subjects). Technical questions were mostly around probability and statistics and its applications. Towards the end of the interview they also asked about my background and hometown related questions.” ****** Ritwik Prashant , a fresher with B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and amongst the most meticulous students within the batch “I started with my introduction and how I was in touch with analytics (Coursera courses). I also described my interests in fantasy football where one has to apply optimizations and statistics in decision making. Technical questions were based around matrices where they made a deep dive until they touched unfamiliar topics. Being a fresher from IIT Madras, they also questioned me about my college placement and my orientation towards this course rather than taking up a job. Thus my entire interview was based on the initial steer I had provided with my introduction.” ****** Pranita Khandelwal , a fresher with dual degree (EEE and Economics) “The interview started off with the recurring question about my degrees- how I ended up studying both Economics and EEE. Later, I was tested on my knowledge of econometrics, and the panel asked some conceptual questions on linear regression and decision making using hypothesis testing. This was followed by questions related to my projects and internships .” ****** Avinash Kumar, a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience “I steered my interview with my introduction towards my college project at USA and my job profile description. The questions covered as to how I could apply data analytics to these projects and how other projects such as six sigma projects are related to analytics. Among technical questions, most of them were based on geometry and also tested my creativity and open mindedness. I had applied through GATE and was oriented towards aerodynamics so I mentioned why I wanted to pursue an analytics career and implement analytics in aerodynamics sector. I highlighted my orientation with awards (NASA system engineering award-1st prize) and description of college project. Even though most of the other candidates had 15 minute interviews that day, mine was a lengthy 35 minute one.” ****** Mukul Kumar , a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience and with same background as Avinash Kumar “Just like Avinash, I steered my interview with my introduction towards why I wanted to pursue analytics. I mentioned how I had researched and gained opinion about analytics from my peers and seniors and felt that the course aligns with my interests in mathematics and thus I can do justice to the course. Technical questions included mathematical ones (hyperbolic functions and their graphs, differentiation,1st differentiation principle and limit) but none on mechanical engineering. I had also applied through GATE and was asked the interview calls I had received. There were also questions based on puzzles and a few questions from written test which we had given during the pre-interview process.” ****** Sujan Biswas – BSc and MSc in chemistry, 2.75 years of experience in Banking and financial services “My panelists began with questions about my background and current job profile and drifted over to mathematical questions covering even and odd functions and matrices. Other questions included optimization based questions and decision making problems such as the methods and parameters one would use to determine whether to provide a loan to an individual or not. There were also situational problems such as – Given that Ph.D students have a higher default rate but high profits and MBA students have lower default rate and lower profits, how would you define your business. Overall my interview was nice and the panelists were not grilling.” ****** Mohammed Tariq , B.Tech in computer science in engineering, 10 months of experience in Business intelligence “Prior to joining the course, I described my experience of a 6-month certification course in analytics. I was also asked about statistics. They asked in-depth questions on calculus going to the levels at which I could not solve. Since I have already done a PG course which used R programming language, Tableau tool and projects, I answered what subjects I learned during the course, experience of the course and my development of interest in PGDBA after completing the course. The interview was mainly focused on my interests in analytics.” Analytics Experience IIM Calcutta Interview PGDBA Student Life students Post navigation Next Article Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge Previous Article PGDBA Interview Experiences – Part 2 Related Articles Interview Experiences PGDBA 2025-27 Interview Experiences Greetings, Future PGDBA Achievers!

December 18, 2015 pgdba_admin Campus Life 5 Comments Here comes our atta boy, our cheerful Madhur Modi to speak about our first semester at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. He is a CS grad, tinted with the experience of working in Acrobat Team, Adobe, India for 11 months. Let’s hear what Madhur says! After a not-so long orientation and pre-semester at IIM C, it was time to move to ISI. All of us were already feeling the attachment we had built with each other and formed the spirit of ‘joka tribe’ within ourselves. We started our journey to learn and started packing… but we were not done with the pre-semester yet! 🙂 Not before we can have a last photo-session! Even the journey to ISI was an insightful one! Filled with discussions of memories made within the short month. Happy faces! I remember us all at the peak of our enthusiasm when we visited ISI for the first time after the orientation, this time for around 6 months with knowledge imparted from renowned teachers. Since each of us had opted for the hostel facilities, the registration day was spent in lodging and document formalities. It all began with 5 subjects, 8 teachers and 51 students – daily two hour classes, twice daily where a moment of flickering attention meant you’ll lose the ability to grasp anything for the rest of the class. Yes! We had teachers who could teach us their subject continuously for two hours and every moment… each of them they made us wonder how amazing it is to learn in an enjoyable fashion. We all felt so comfortable moving from our 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional minds to nth dimensions and then move down using multidimensional scaling ☺ ☺ (was I too technical here? Come to ISI and you’ll know what I mean). I bet all our teachers from ISI would be laughing reading the joke here. By the ways, if you’re writing about ISI, it won’t be a just article if you do not mention each teacher separately! Starting from our class teacher and DBMS teacher prof. Pinakpani Pal, it was him who would come to our rescue each time, whether it is to change the mess, requirement of any additional facilities, aid in any procedures or help regarding the subject. He would kindly reach out his hand and solve all our problems in a flick. DBMS was also taught by prof. Amiya and prof. Dilip who would take care of SQL teaching for us. Thanks to him, DBMS was one of the most comfortable subjects in ISI. I still remember the fact that 44 teachers have bhattacharya awards in their name! We all used to marvel at the level of knowledge at ISI, rather, we felt grateful to our teachers for feeding such golden nuggets of information to us daily and Prof. Debasis is the teacher who’s teaching reminded us the reasons they won those awards. I always felt that he teaches one subject but I learned things anyone would consider is worth much more! From histograms, scatter plots, distributions and tests for distributions, he took us to bivariate and the multivariate analysis followed by more tests and feature selection. Moreover, he took extra classes and doubt sessions every week just to ensure that when we learn, we learn well When you start talking about the teachers, each teacher is better than the other! We had Statistical Probabilistic Analysis taught by two teachers, Prof. Bimal and Prof. Kishan. It was the only subject with no assignments, since probability has such a wide scope. This class was all practical, we were given real life examples and applied concepts to solve them. There was yet another similar subject, inference, taught by Prof. Amitava which encompassed all other subjects and drew inference tests from each of them, filled with more real life examples. We had one more course, or rather, set of course ☺ Computing in data science taught by Prof. Saurav Sengupta. I could proudly say to those non-cse students who fear how they would learn programming techniques- this is the course that will help you make your first transition. From practically negligible knowledge, this course taught us not just R and Python, but also made us do an entire team project to deep seat the lessons in our hearts. The best thing? We had fun! I would frequently visit the course website and our project blog and proudly say that we have come far, far from where we were when we entered ISI. P.S. do check out the blog of group 1 authored by our group. 🙂 Didn’t I mention anything else besides studies? How forgetful of me! ISI is a place of happenings! Every other day there were announcements of workshops in various fields of statistics and there were a variety of activities which would now be sweet memories for us with ISI. We flew kites, we had birthday parties, we played games and we had our first formal photoshoot! Looking smart! ISI also had a very special memory… Diwali! What’s that? How did we celebrate it? I could boast that it was better than any student had celebrated while at college! Two of our batchmates, Mr. Avinash (a.k.a. Gandhi) and Mukul cleaned their room and turned it into the Pooja venue (see photos in link) We made diyas, did Pooja, sang bhakti songs, distributed Prasad and made rangoli ! We burnt a few crackers and all our rooms illuminated with the auspiciousness on that day! It was one of the best Diwali celebrations of my life! Diwali! Soon after Durga puja, Diwali and Kali puja, we had our final exams and had to say “Bye Bye ISI” I am thankful that our first semester was conducted at ISI where we learnt such a great deal and progressed so far ahead in our skills. It already feels like we can do most of business analytics even though we have ways to go. How could be go away without saying a delightful adios to our Indian Statistical institute? We requested all the teachers to come for a final photoshoot session. Besides one photo present in CDS website , another photo from the last day would mark a fitting ending to our memories and knowledge lending roller coaster ride at the pillar of statistical, mathematical and machine learning institute!

I hope you have applied! ABHISHEK AGRAWAL January 19, 2016 Reply I have applied for the test. Could you please tell me what to expect in interview from your experience as i have around 2 months to prepare for it. Madhur Modi January 20, 2016 Reply At this point, do focus on the written test first. You should again be prepared with mathematics for the interview as well. Most of the other questions besides maths are similar to a typical IIM interview. You will need to prepare additional topics as well such as probability and differentiation. Based on your profile, some specific questions might be asked. Also, stay tuned for future posts on the blog where we may post further insights!

It was a crisp Friday morning and I was seated comfortably in the plush IIMC library. The PGDBA semester was well underway, assignments were raining thick and fast…life was busy…life was good and I was brimming with excitement. I had only just begun working on a competition, which had started 4 days ago on June 14th 2016. It was an inter-university data-science competition called the Data Science Game . With so many constraints such as limited number of submissions in a day and final selection of only one team from a college, it was, by all means the “big deal” and a glance at the list of competing universities showed us some tough nuts. There were the usual suspects i.e. Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford et al., supplemented by a host of premier universities from across the world. Certainly our team of four from first-ever batch of PGDBA, though no novices, were far from being among the best in the world… or were they? And so we – Team Tabs – prepared a starting output, clicked on the ‘Make Submission’ button and waited with a muted yet expectation-laced anxiety that any Kaggler worth his salt would be familiar with and then this image popped up on our screen: Most authors describe moments like these with the cliche ‘There was a moment of silence followed by….’ I discovered that they were quite wrong…as my uncontrollable Hagrid-like laughter filled the breadth of the IIM Calcutta library, defiant of the several bemused yet stern glares that were pointed in my direction! Second in the whole world! Irrespective of its ephemerality, irrespective of the pains required to maintain it or the challenges that we were about to face in the coming three weeks – it was a moment of reckoning for us, a moment to cherish, a moment to savour. Yet, when I look back I can say with certainty that it was at this point I started believing that international glory wasn’t beyond our reach. What followed were some of the most gruelling days of my life. Over the next three weeks, we went on to learn and implement Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithms for image classification. We travelled to multiple universities in a quest for servers to run these algorithms. We learnt, we toiled, we toiled hard and we thrived. When the competition ended, we were the top team from India – Yes! Our hard work and perseverance led to us being the Rank 1 Indian team . We were among the 20 teams from around the world selected to travel to Paris for the final phase of the competition and folks, as you read this article, we’re on the flight journey towards the finals of the competition in Paris, to be held on 9th September. What fills me with even more delight is that not just us, but three teams from India have made it to the final 20 – one each from IIM Calcutta-Team Tabs, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata- The Frequentists (in their ranking order). India has made its presence felt in this 2nd edition of Data Science Game and interestingly enough, all the three institutes are what together constitute PGDBA! It is encouraging to see that three Indian teams have proved themselves worthy of being the global top 20 when 146 teams from 28 countries participated and showed their mettle in this grueling competition. The competition contained an image classification problem. A set of images were given, which had to be classified into four categories. The problem at hand could have been done in various ways. We decided to use deep learning as a lot of interesting work is being done around it and it’s one of the most advanced techniques currently available. We had a basic knowledge about it and developed more understanding as we moved along. The process of compiling and executing codes went on and we worked hard every single day. The machine learning algorithms take time to execute and with limited computing power at our disposal and time constraint of the competition, we ensured that every iota of it was used. As we were fighting neck to neck with all top notch universities across the world, the task was not at all easy and there were a lot of hurdles on the way. The limited computing power slowed us down. Every iteration of the code required a whole day and thus constrained our capacity to experiment with the algorithm. Soon other teams caught up with us on the leaderboard. To wrinkle out the problems we went to IIT-KGP and ISI to gain server access. However, the terminals at both places were preoccupied. As a last resort, we decided to use Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was difficult to set-up because of the complex technicalities and as none of us was acquainted with the process, it made our job all the more difficult. We quickly took charge and read about it from the scratch, spending a precious time of 3 days to figure everything out and get it running. In hindsight, it was worth the effort. Our first run in AWS increased the accuracy by 5 % and it all paid off with the jump on the leaderboard. Now that we look at it, a lot of edge was given to us by our PGDBA curriculum. The basics of machine learning and computing were well laid out throughout the course. It enabled us to deep dive into deep learning and comprehend the technical aspects around it. We also consulted with professors for guidance. With Team Tabs standing at 12 in global rankings, we realize that we have learnt a lot on the way, when we were actually working on the problem statement. We will now be competing with some of the top Kagglers in the finals. The finale would certainly provide us with global exposure as we will get a macroscopic view of what’s happening around the world in the field of data science by interacting with top-notch data analysts spread across the world. Since it’s a 2-day competition, the dynamics of the game is bound to change. We haven’t been able to put in continuous concentrated efforts towards the final round owing to the rigorous academic curriculum this semester and us coping up on classes. We do have a lot to cover but we will keep learning new stuff as we have been doing in the past year. Thus a great opportunity for knowledge transfer and networking lies ahead. With everyone’s hopes in us, we make our journey to Paris, where the final leg of the competition awaits… along with our fateful turnout in the 2nd Data Science Game competition.

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Reply Venkatesh says: January 16, 2016 at 9:17 am Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:36 am For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well. Reply Hardik Agarwal says: March 27, 2016 at 12:44 pm URGENT : If I don’t have an important document that has to be shown during the interview process in original (as said in the call letter), can I show its copy and give an undertaking of that? Will it work or will they cancel my candidature? Thanks in advance. Reply Madhur Modi says: April 20, 2016 at 10:04 am The interviews are already over. I think you would have already received the instructions from the panel about this Reply subhodeep says: April 19, 2016 at 10:28 am hi, i converted my PGDBA call. i am looking forward to join this course and very optimistic about it. just need to convince myself that avg salary will be equivalent to PGDM of IIMC. how is the industry perceiving this course. are companies like BCG and MCG lined up for PGDBA?

I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

There was a panel of 3 interviewers – one from each institute. Himanshu Goyal – B.Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering, 2011 , IIT Delhi; 5 years of experience in BFSI, Global Analytics Duration: 20-25 mins Questions that were asked: Tell us about your achievements Why do you want to join PGDBA Write equation for linear and logistic regression (was asked due to my background at work) A puzzle which used the property of mean A question on odds ratio and probability Experience and Review: Why PGDBA? or Why should we take you? needs to be very well prepared. You should be able to show that you are serious about this course and are making an informed choice. Everyone has a reason of their own and you will have to find one for yourself as well which you can pitch. In case you have work experience, you should be able to explain your roles and responsibilities in a comprehensive and confident way. My interview didn’t go well and I remember not being hopeful after it but my written test had gone very good which must have had a good impact. ————————————————————————– Waqar Sarguroh – B. Tech. in Chemical Engineering, IIT Roorkee, 2014; 25 months of work experience in Oil and Gas (Refinery) and EdTech Startup Duration: 20 mins Asked to explain the product of the EdTech startup that I worked for. Discussed customer segmentation based on usage of app. Asked to explain classification and clustering and explain the difference. The interviewers were very helpful as I had only an elementary idea about the concept. They walked me through the thought process by asking guiding questions. An algebraic expression of positive integers to be maximised given a constraint. (Using AM > GM) What is BRICS? What is the economic situation of BRICS countries? Did you write CAT? Why not an MBA? SUGGESTIONS-The main focus was on the ability to think through a problem. Building on ideas and communicating your thought process appropriately. ————————————————————————– Anushree Parsai – B.E. in Electronics and Communication, BITS Hyderabad, 2014; 2 years of work experience at ARM Duration: 30-40 mins As my interview questions were mostly centered around current affairs, I feel the interviewers were looking for students who were good at academics and also kept track of current events of national and international importance. They asked me following questions – Which states will be having elections this year? Do you know about GST bill? How will it help? State 3 major achievements of Narendra Modi so far? Factors responsible for Syria conflict and views on it? Based On Work experience: How are defects identified in electronic chips? Define defect and differentiate it from from fault. There was one basic question on mathematics as well on finding continuity of a function. ————————————————————————– Naveen Mittal – B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering, KNIT Sultanpur, 2016 Duration: 20-25 mins Most of the questions related to Computer Science such as complexities of algorithms, sorting, searching, N-P hard problems, etc. Also, questions from management subjects in B.Tech curriculum such as IM, IS, IP were asked. Problems were given which required basic applications of statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation etc. and drawing inferences using such measures. Calculus questions were asked, theorems such as Cauchy-Reimann, etc. were asked. Some HR questions like Why do you want to join PGDBA?? SUGGESTIONS-Be confident. Even if you do not know some of the answers don’t think that you can bluff with them. Say politely that you cannot recollect or remember the answer. I was able to answer Computer Science and Engineering related questions which happen to be my discipline during B.Tech. and maintain a positive attitude and confidence throughout the interview. ————————————————————————– Khushiram Sharma – B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering, IIT(BHU) Varanasi, 2013; 36 months of experience in BPCL as Retail Engineer and Asst. Mgr., Operations. Duration: 25 mins They asked me to briefly explain my profile of work. As I have been to many places during this time and the last one being Gorakhpur (UP), they picked a question from there. They asked me to give five cultural differences between UP & Rajasthan(I am from Ajmer) and also explain how they are different. They stopped me when I had explained four of them convincingly. They asked one question on maths which is as follows : We have identified four places in Rajasthan to be made headquarters of education for state. Out of these we have to finally select only three based on the distances need to be travelled by people in future. All other conditions will remain same for all places. Given this before jumping for any solution, I discussed about further assumptions like population density, shape can be assumed as per my drawing, people will travel to their nearest headquarter (as per straight line distance). Finally they said, all other conditions will remain same for all places. After trying for 2 minutes, they made little bit easier i.e. I have three locations and have to select two of them. Now I drew perpendicular bisectors of this triangle and then explained the solution. They asked me whether I know coding, and I said” primarily no except that I studied C language 6 years ago.” Then they asked to write a code for printing my name(string) in reverse order, which I did. I think your approach to the given problem will be a crucial factor in cracking the interview. ————————————————————————– Himanshu Jain – B.E. in Electronics and Communications Engineering, NSIT Delhi, 2013; 11 months of experience in IT Advisory (Analytics) Consultancy, KPMG; 24 months of experience in Samsung Data Systems (IT industry) Duration: 15-20 mins. P1: starts the interview asking me about my college history and Delhi Current political scenario, what I think about Arvind Kejriwal and what has changed in Delhi since AAP came to power & then asked about some Co-curricular activities. P2(IIT professor of around 40+ age) asked about my work experience as I was working in analytics field Me: I explained about my current client project and what different domains I was working on over the years. P3(one having knowledge of Statistics & maths; must be from ISI): Q1. Given a graph with a normal distribution of mean 30 marks. Also, 20% students have more than 45 marks. So how much % of students have marks ranging from 15 to 45? Q2. Asked to draw a circle and how to find the centre of a circle. I asked some questions in the end about what I can study before joining this course which would help me during PGDBA if I got selected. P2 smiled and replied just chill and enjoy. ————————————————————————– Yogesh Dewangan- B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering, NIT Raipur, 2013; Fresher Duration: 25 mins There were 3 interviewers sitting, 2 males 1 female. Interviewer (I): So Yogesh, tell me something about yourself. Me: Described a little about my background, education, then hobbies and lastly archery (I wanted them to ask on this only ). I: Oh, so you are an archer. Tell us about your achievements in archery. Do you have any certificates related to archery? Me: (showed all national and state championship certificates) I(handed over the file to another interviewer): You can have a good career in archery, then why do you want to do this course? Do you plan to continue it in future? Me: Of course sir, I am very passionate about archery. Our state does not have good facilities and environment for archery. I wish to set-up an archery academy in my state. It will have a great help to the archery community and will also attract new talents. Whatever problems I have faced as a beginner, I do not want the next generation of archers to face them. I: So have you done something in this regard? Me: Yes sir. We have formed a club and para-archery association which helps beginners and needy archers and promotes archery. I personally contribute annually to the club and I like training beginners. I: You seem to be good at maths. Can you solve a few questions. Gave two equation which I don’t remember, but were of the form x=… and y=…(quadratic in the form of x) and told me to prove that y is multiple of 9. You have a triangle of sides a, b and c. Tell me the sufficient and necessary conditions for the triangle to exist. Tell me the range and domain for x in: y = 1/(log|x|) I: Can you tell me some headlines on today’s newspaper? You belong to Chhattisgarh. What are your views about Naxalism. What they want and what you govt is doing to tackle them. Me: Told that they want to run a parallel govt and do not want govt to have any interference in their area. They follow violent route to get their demands fulfilled. Told about the kidnapping of District collector and killing of Congress leaders in 2013. Then told about govt policies and incentives about bringing Naxalites in the mainstream. FEEDBACK: Major criteria for my selection, according to me was my score in the written exam. It played a vital role. Next may be my 10th 12th percentages (both 80+). Then, interview, which I felt went well. I was able to make them ask on archery. I knew Naxalism would come and hence was prepared with it. Everything that was asked to me, I was able to answer. I would say it was totally an expected interview. ————————————————————————– Apoorv Agarwal – B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from NITK Surathkal, 2013; 30 months of experience in HealthCare Insurance, UnitedHealth Group Information Services Pvt. Ltd. Duration: 15-20 mins My interview proceeded as follows: Tell me about yourself (2 minutes) Work Experience (3-5 minutes) Q: What was your work profile? A: I was working as a database analyst in UnitedHealth Group, briefly explained about the project and my role in the company. They were more interested in analytics related work or if we were using any machine learning algorithm. Since we were not using any sophisticated machine learning algorithm at that point of time, I told him how we were doing descriptive analytics in SQL server. Probability/Statistics Questions (2-3 minutes): I was asked to write the probability density function, mean and variance of the Poisson distribution. Real life examples of Poisson and exponential distribution. Bayes Theorem – He asked me to state Bayes theorem and its application. Graduation (2 minutes) Interviewer asked me to explain the principle behind swing bowling in cricket(as I did my B.Tech in mechanical engineering and mentioned cricket in my hobbies). I explained it through Bernoulli’s effect, pressure difference and then there were a couple of questions on Bernoulli’s theorem. What motivates you to the field of analytics(2-4 minutes): As I was working in the healthcare industry, so I started with the importance of data analytics in the field of healthcare insurance, how we can reduce the overall healthcare cost and serve patients in a better way. I continued my explanation with other sectors and explained how we can leverage data analytics to make effective decisions. They wanted to check my interest in analytics. Extra Curricular Activities: Sachin Tendulkar Vs Virat Kohli- They were interested in statistical analysis behind my answer. ————————————————————————– Kapil Tripathi – B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering, NIT Allahabad, 2014; 18 months of experience in Manufacturing (Power Function), Trident Group and 5 months in a Project at BHEL Duration: 20 mins. My Complete Interview Experience – Tell me something about yourself? Q- (IIM Prof) What is your motivation for joining this programme? I told them about my start-up idea in power sector which deals purely with analytics and how this programme can help me achieve that. Q- (IIT Prof) He said these things shall not be implemented in India. Explained that how government of India has set up 1000 crores for the modernisation of electrical transmission quality and the function delivering those results shall be analytics Q- (ISI Prof) You like electrical ? Can you derive RMS value for a sinusoidal current waveform? Q-(ISI Prof) Given machines downtime periods how the spare parts in your store shall be taken care of ? Any graphs you can plot etc. After some thought, explained about frequency of various spares used in last downtime periods and based on that data we shall generate some bar plots etc. Q-(IIT Prof) Any analytics experience? I told them that I have seen implementation of Aspen tech boiler controller in which learning by controller was done for a month. SUGGESTIONS – To be as frank and confident as possible. Decent communication skill and good applied thinking shall be enough for interview. Avoid saying extreme technical terms of which you are not aware of as they will cross question. ————————————————————————– Ishita Lohia – B.Tech. in Computer Science, College Of Technology, G.B.P.U.A.T., Pantnagar, 2014; 12 months of experience in Tech Mahindra (IT industry) Duration-25 mins. What all tools did I work on ? Why do we use SQL and not Excel for the retrieval of data. Some very basic questions on what our application was and how exactly was I contributing to the organization. Few questions were asked from JAVA and data structures too. What is cumulative frequency? They drew a graph of the cumulative frequency for the number of girls vs marks they scored and did the same for the boys and asked who performed better(girls or boys). They asked me to explain normal distribution and few trailing questions on that. They asked me about different raag as I had participated in singing events. ————————————————————————– Palash R Tatte – B.Tech. in Production and Industrial engineering, IIT Delhi, 2014; 23 months of experience in Healthcare analytics, IMS Health Duration: 30 mins Questions about my work, grilling me on fine details whenever anything regarding stats or maths was mentioned. Based on previous answer, questions about moving averages when I mentioned forecasting as a part of my work; they tried to dig deep into regression, R square (they asked me to write down its formula) It seemed they were waiting to throw hardcore math questions. But somehow discussion moved on to operations research (but be prepared for math questions, specially when you’re a fresher) and they asked me to solve a full LP problem. I tried to act smart and solved it graphically for 2 variables which did not go in my favor; they stopped me in between and asked me to do it using SIMPLEX after which I gave up. Who do you think is a better player, Kohli or Tendulkar? They asked about hobbies; on cricket, they asked whether I played any Inter IIT and which ones. They asked about my extra-curricular activities at college. Questions like if not PGDBA, then what? ————————————————————————– Kallu Chandra Mouli – B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering, NIT Trichy, 2014; 11 months of experience in FCA (Automobile industry) Duration: 30-35 mins Many questions were asked related to work experience. It began with questions like briefly explain a day in your office and questions were followed from what I answered. Few questions were asked about the tools and projects at work. One question was asked about different types of schemas implemented in databases and then types of transformations in Informatica. How would we clean data before entering them into a database . Challenges faced at work . How would you explain a flat file to your grandma. They also asked standard HR questions – Why PGDBA. What are your hobbies- I replied cycling and then we had a small discussion regarding cycle prices in India and abroad. There were very basic questions related to normal distributions. I was also asked to solve a question on permutation and combination and then one more from linear equations. Both of them were of CAT standards. I think they were looking for people with interest towards analytics and good understanding of fundamental maths and statistics. ————————————————————————– For the next part of this post: PGDBA 2016-18 Interview Experiences Part-2 Here are the links to the interview experiences of the first batch of PGDBA: PGDBA 2015-17 Interview Experiences – Part-1 PGDBA 2015-17 Interview Experiences – Part 2 Post navigation Next Article Wiser By A Semester Of Statistics Previous Article PGDBA 2016-18 Interview Experiences Part-2 Related Articles Interview Experiences PGDBA 2025-27 Interview Experiences Greetings, Future PGDBA Achievers!

It was an honour to interact with a Padma Shree awardee in Dr. Bimal Roy. To be taught on a regular basis by such an esteemed personality was slightly overwhelming and hugely enriching. The sheer brilliance of the man and his way of looking at probability and its applications was an experience difficult to pen down. Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta shared the course and taught Markov Chains. Satyendra Nath bhavan , ISI Campus Diligent and sincere, Prof. Debashish Sengupta was the ideal teacher. He covered every topic rigorously starting right with the basics of statistics to the highly complex multivariate analysis. What seemed an easy course initially, became heavily loaded and among the toughest by the time the course came to its completion. Tutorials were held every week to discuss exercise problems. The jovial Prof. Amitava Banerjee taught us the habit of drawing meaningful inferences out of large volumes of data. Drawing from his vast pool of consultancy experience, he inculcated in us the ability to convert real life business problems into statistical problems. His assignments involved working on datasets and testing hypothesis in the correct way. Dr. Pinakpani Pal was interactive, and worked hard to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. His course had 2 parts: the theoretical knowledge of databases, and a hands-on SQL application. He shared the course with Amiya Das, a seasoned professional at Oracle. The friendly and ever enthusiastic Dr Sourav Sengupta was always approachable and motivated the entire batch in getting accustomed with highly complex ideas. His passion for teaching shone through as he went through the concepts of linear algebra and machine learning algorithms. He organised the course superbly and the web page for his course was among the best resource repositories we could have hoped for. The invited lectures were top drawer, with experienced professionals coming in to share their insights and recommendations about the field of analytics. Overall the first semester was a learning experience beyond compare and laid a solid foundation on which we can build in our journey towards becoming well-rounded data scientists.

Categories Articles General The mission of PGDBA Post author By pgdba_admin Post date January 10, 2020 No Comments on The mission of PGDBA Sticky post By Anurag Malakar, PGDBA Batch-5 (2019-21) The year 2005 | A regular morning in a middle-class Indian’s life The middle-aged mom heaved a sigh of relief, having just sent off her kids on the school bus. It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 12, 2017 No Comments on What is PGDBA? “Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.” – Geoffrey Moore, Organizational Theorist & Author Analytics: Need of the Hour The amount of data in our world is exploding. As per a McKinsey report, big data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function the same way as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition. The increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media and the Internet of Things will fuel exponential growth in data in the foreseeable future. The rapid pace with which data is being generated across various domains and fields would require people with deep analytical skills to provide insights, enabling companies to gain a competitive edge and offer a better consumer experience. The insights from the data are used for various purposes such as segmentation of customers for better targeting, prediction of churn rate, product recommendation, analysis of customer opinion from media posts, preventive maintenance, management of portfolio risk etc. Untapped potential in India In India, the analytics market is expected to double between 2013 and 2018, reaching a figure of US$ 2.3 billion by 2018, according to a report published by NASSCOM and Blueocean Market Intelligence. This will result in a shortage of about 200,000 data scientists in India over the next few years, according to sources in the Analytics Special Interest Group setup by NASSCOM. Hence, creation of trained industry-ready business analytics professionals is the need of the day. Globally, the demand of data scientists is projected to exceed supply by more than 50% by 2018. To address the paucity of trained workforce in analytics domain, the onus is on the educational institutes to address the needs of the industry. The three institutes IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata are aware of the demand for the well rounded analytics professionals. In order to understand the needs of the industry, a day long conclave was held in January 2015 in IIM Calcutta. Representatives of the leading companies such as KPMG, EXL, Deloitte, LatentView, TCS, Reliance Communication, Deutsche Bank, E&Y, SBI, IBM, Google, Microsoft, HSBC and Cognizant took part in the conclave and based on their inputs, ideas of a specialized course emerged, a course which would produce leaders of the future, skilled in the essential areas of business, statistics and computer science. Through this collaboration between industry and academia, PGDBA was born. Introduction to PGDBA PGDBA is a two year full time residential diploma programme aimed at creating business analytics professionals employable by leading Indian and foreign firms. This programme is designed for those who have an analytical mindset, are interested in tackling challenging business problems, and possess an inclination towards Mathematics. Some of the salient features of the programme include courses taught by reputed faculty members at the campuses of three globally renowned institutes, hands-on business analytics training at a related company, continuous interaction with industry leaders throughout the duration of the programme and the availability of placement opportunities at all the three institutes. The three institutes complement each other to give students the most comprehensive learning of business analytics. The course finds the optimal balance between the theoretical concepts of data science and their applications to business problems. Students get to regularly interact with industry experts through invited talks and guest lectures, where experts talk about the latest trends and challenges in the industry. The course leverages the best of the three institutes in their respective fields of expertise, i.e., Statistics, Technology and Business. In the first semester at ISI, students form a strong base of Mathematical and Statistical concepts. This is followed by a semester at IIT Kharagpur, where students work on data science projects and get to test their statistical concepts built at ISI. This semester is meant to build students’ technical expertise. To complement the first two semesters, students spend their third semester at IIM Calcutta where they are exposed to business problems through case studies and industry interactions. To cap it all, the students get to implement their knowledge in the industry through a six months long internship as their fourth semester. Placements The students from the first two batches of PGDBA experienced highly successful placement processes. Companies from various industries such as BFSI, Consulting, Healthcare, Research, Retail, Gaming, Technology etc. participated and handpicked candidates suitable for both data-driven and business driven analyst roles. The placement processes witnessed the involvement of Fortune 500 companies such as American Express, Walmart Labs, UnitedHealth Group, JPMC, Amazon, Walmart Labs. Some of the job profiles offered were Senior Data Scientist, Analytics Manager, Statistical Analyst, Lead Business Analyst, Solution Analyst, Experienced Associate, Assistant Project Manager. With continuously increasing demand of business analytics professionals, the future of PGDBA looks promising. The unique opportunity of learning from three top-notch institutes of the country is unparalleled by any other Data Analytics course. Recently, PGDBA was ranked 1 by the Analytics India Magazine among the data science courses offered in the country. Stay tuned for more updates Follow us on Facebook Categories Articles Chronicles Experiences Foreign Internships: Ambassadors of PGDBA Post author By pgdba_admin Post date November 7, 2016 1 Comment on Foreign Internships: Ambassadors of PGDBA As the founding batch prepares for their final placements, we bring to you a sneak peek into the persona of a unique group of people who are going to cross the borders for their 6-month long internships. Madhur Modi It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds. Here’s a showcase of their profiles: Alok Mani Singh The civil engineer from BHEL, and the “stud” with 4-year worth of experience from a Maharatna PSU and IIT Guwahati attached in his name was the first person who secured his foreign intern in the prestigious Dunia Finance in Dubai. The “Perfect Statistician” as well as the “Management expert” who can solve any problem that comes his way “within a night or two”. He also likes to play guitar and has entertained us for past one and a half years with his pleasant voice. Now he will be working closely with the head of strategic analytics function at Dunia during his 6-month internship in Dubai. Siddhant Sanjeev “Coder” as everyone in the batch knows him to be, was the only other person to impress the company Dunia and accompany Alok to Dubai. Everyone in the batch knows him as a fresher with computer science background from NSIT and a national level coder. He also got himself an interview offer from Google owing to his coding skills as well as won case competitions from PwC and Deloitte. He also developed an e-commerce website using intricate concepts of natural language processing, recommendation systems and information retrieval. Ankitkumar Sonthalia Better known as “Sonthu”, this guy has 3 years of work experience from Cognizant and now he is going to work for Rocket Internet in Myanmar. He has worked on marketing strategy, predictions and recommendation systems. He is a travel enthusiast and has organized many unforgettable trips for our batch. He has also conducted cricket fantasy league and freshers’ party. Rachit Tripathi A mechanical engineer from IIT Kanpur by mind and a quant trader by heart, Rachit bagged an internship in France at QuantCube Technology, a niche fintech company. He’s also part of the team selected for data science game, an international inter-university competition held in Paris. In his pursuit of becoming a quant trader, he obtained CFA level 1 certification and solved various cases from those on Walmart to those on Yahoo data. He is also known as the “data scientist” of the batch and has recently been selected as one of the finalists in Goldman Sachs Quantify competition. Avinash Kumar He is a mechanical engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has worked in L&T for 3 years. He was offered an internship at Rocket Internet which he did not take as he aspired to work in India. He has written an international research paper and also has been part of the Data Science Game with Rachit during this course. He also won NASA systems engineering award while being a B.Tech. student. Besides, he is also a skilled TT player as well as a chess enthusiast. Bharathi Ramaraj Bharathi got the internship offer from Rocket Internet but she decided to stay in India. The only girl to get a foreign internship offer, she is a fresher with B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering. She has worked on uplift modeling, high-frequency data and news analytics and has taken part in various Kaggle competitions. She is also an international chess player and has traveled to as many as 16 countries representing India. She envisions being a financial analyst and to use advanced analytics techniques in a financial credit company to build her career. Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world. Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics. Categories Articles Experiences ISI Chapter Chances of Consequence Post author By pgdba_admin Post date September 20, 2016 No Comments on Chances of Consequence Grown-ups love figures. When you tell them that you’ve made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, “What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. -The Little Prince Our first exams in this first semester at ISI have finally arrived. One of the subjects of the course, and of the more interesting ones I might add, is ‘Probability and Stochastic Processes’. This was also the subject of our first exam. I have been pouring over notes and hundreds of pages of text in preparation of this exam. The intricacies in some of the ideas reminded me of these lines taken from ‘The Little Prince’ and quoted by David Freedman in his book on Statistics. Are such matters as figures and charts always dry and boring? In our first class, the professor of the same subject also remarked, “Maybe our insistence on numbers is the limitation of man”. ‘The Little Prince’ is a famous classic written by Saint Antoine du Exupery. Although it was first written as a children’s book, it has been enjoyed over the years by adults alike as a heart-warming story on friendship, growing-up and the curious fascinations of man. One of the oft used coinages in the book is the phrase ‘matters of consequence’. The Little Prince finds, at one point, a man aimlessly counting stars to the extent that he reaches ‘five hundred and one million’. This man then ironically refers to his counting as a matter of consequence. In these days leading up to our exams, I began to wonder whether factuality could be made interesting in the context of some intricacies I came across in problems of Probability Theory. Are there questions that I can ask that are not as dry as the character’s occupation of counting in The Little Prince? Consider the following questions. How many random people would I need to collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that at least two of them share their birthdays? The answer to this is a surprisingly low number. Let’s look at a different question. How many people would I need to catch hold of and ask birthdays of to have half a chance of finding someone who shares my birthday? It is also interesting to note that this number is different from the first one. Louis CK, the famous stand-up comedian, made an interesting remark in one of his live shows. He said that there were enough people attending his show for there to be a fair chance that a few of them would die in the coming year. Ouch! Let’s pose that as a question on chance. Assume a population with a certain death rate. What is the number of people I would have to randomly collect in a room, such that there would be half a chance that someone would die tomorrow? Enough with birthdays and death days. Consider coin tosses. Say, I keep tossing a coin and keep getting heads for a hundred tosses. I only know that it is equally likely that my coin is anything between a perfectly rigged coin to a perfectly fair coin. What is the chance that I win if I bet on the next toss to be heads? Let’s stretch this slightly further. Let us assume that when the universe was born, the probability that the sun would rise over planet earth each day was made to depend on a coin toss. We only know that this coin was likely to be anything between a perfectly fair to a perfectly unfair coin (God is playing a cruel game). What is the probability that the sun would rise tomorrow, given that it has been rising each day over all these years since the birth of the universe? Let’s give some rest to our poor coin and move on to other questions. The Monty Hall Problem is a famous example on how sometimes the idea of chance can stump intuition. Here’s a different example in a similar vein. Suppose there are three suspects in jail who have been cleared of any wrongdoing and are all going to be released soon. It is announced that two of the three would be released the next day but these three don’t know exactly which two of them will be released. One of them decides to go ask the guard which one of the other two prisoners is going to be released. But then he thinks the following to himself, “After I have asked, I have only a one in two chance that I’m the second guy to be released. But before I ask, there is a two in three chance that I will be one of the guys to be released. So should I rather not ask?” Like one of our professors quips so often, ‘Remember that there’s a chance model somewhere in the background.’ Somebody somewhere is flipping a coin. Maybe someday a story will be written on a travelling mathematician who visits magical planets to ask questions on chances of consequence. It’s a long shot that it would be anything as beautiful as the masterpiece that is the ‘The Little Prince’. But I wager it wouldn’t be as bad as dry pointless counting. Categories Articles Experiences Technical Joka Library to Paris – A Data Science Crusade Post author By pgdba_admin Post date September 7, 2016 No Comments on Joka Library to Paris – A Data Science Crusade A peek into Team Tabs, one of the three teams representing India at DSG. It was a crisp Friday morning and I was seated comfortably in the plush IIMC library. The PGDBA semester was well underway, assignments were raining thick and fast…life was busy…life was good and I was brimming with excitement. I had only just begun working on a competition, which had started 4 days ago on June 14th 2016. It was an inter-university data-science competition called the Data Science Game . With so many constraints such as limited number of submissions in a day and final selection of only one team from a college, it was, by all means the “big deal” and a glance at the list of competing universities showed us some tough nuts. There were the usual suspects i.e. Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford et al., supplemented by a host of premier universities from across the world. Certainly our team of four from first-ever batch of PGDBA, though no novices, were far from being among the best in the world… or were they? And so we – Team Tabs – prepared a starting output, clicked on the ‘Make Submission’ button and waited with a muted yet expectation-laced anxiety that any Kaggler worth his salt would be familiar with and then this image popped up on our screen: Most authors describe moments like these with the cliche ‘There was a moment of silence followed by….’ I discovered that they were quite wrong…as my uncontrollable Hagrid-like laughter filled the breadth of the IIM Calcutta library, defiant of the several bemused yet stern glares that were pointed in my direction! Second in the whole world! Irrespective of its ephemerality, irrespective of the pains required to maintain it or the challenges that we were about to face in the coming three weeks – it was a moment of reckoning for us, a moment to cherish, a moment to savour. Yet, when I look back I can say with certainty that it was at this point I started believing that international glory wasn’t beyond our reach. What followed were some of the most gruelling days of my life. Over the next three weeks, we went on to learn and implement Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithms for image classification. We travelled to multiple universities in a quest for servers to run these algorithms. We learnt, we toiled, we toiled hard and we thrived. When the competition ended, we were the top team from India – Yes! Our hard work and perseverance led to us being the Rank 1 Indian team . We were among the 20 teams from around the world selected to travel to Paris for the final phase of the competition and folks, as you read this article, we’re on the flight journey towards the finals of the competition in Paris, to be held on 9th September. What fills me with even more delight is that not just us, but three teams from India have made it to the final 20 – one each from IIM Calcutta-Team Tabs, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata- The Frequentists (in their ranking order). India has made its presence felt in this 2nd edition of Data Science Game and interestingly enough, all the three institutes are what together constitute PGDBA! It is encouraging to see that three Indian teams have proved themselves worthy of being the global top 20 when 146 teams from 28 countries participated and showed their mettle in this grueling competition. The competition contained an image classification problem. A set of images were given, which had to be classified into four categories. The problem at hand could have been done in various ways. We decided to use deep learning as a lot of interesting work is being done around it and it’s one of the most advanced techniques currently available. We had a basic knowledge about it and developed more understanding as we moved along. The process of compiling and executing codes went on and we worked hard every single day. The machine learning algorithms take time to execute and with limited computing power at our disposal and time constraint of the competition, we ensured that every iota of it was used. As we were fighting neck to neck with all top notch universities across the world, the task was not at all easy and there were a lot of hurdles on the way. The limited computing power slowed us down. Every iteration of the code required a whole day and thus constrained our capacity to experiment with the algorithm. Soon other teams caught up with us on the leaderboard. To wrinkle out the problems we went to IIT-KGP and ISI to gain server access. However, the terminals at both places were preoccupied. As a last resort, we decided to use Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was difficult to set-up because of the complex technicalities and as none of us was acquainted with the process, it made our job all the more difficult. We quickly took charge and read about it from the scratch, spending a precious time of 3 days to figure everything out and get it running. In hindsight, it was worth the effort. Our first run in AWS increased the accuracy by 5 % and it all paid off with the jump on the leaderboard. Now that we look at it, a lot of edge was given to us by our PGDBA curriculum. The basics of machine learning and computing were well laid out throughout the course. It enabled us to deep dive into deep learning and comprehend the technical aspects around it. We also consulted with professors for guidance. With Team Tabs standing at 12 in global rankings, we realize that we have learnt a lot on the way, when we were actually working on the problem statement. We will now be competing with some of the top Kagglers in the finals. The finale would certainly provide us with global exposure as we will get a macroscopic view of what’s happening around the world in the field of data science by interacting with top-notch data analysts spread across the world. Since it’s a 2-day competition, the dynamics of the game is bound to change. We haven’t been able to put in continuous concentrated efforts towards the final round owing to the rigorous academic curriculum this semester and us coping up on classes. We do have a lot to cover but we will keep learning new stuff as we have been doing in the past year. Thus a great opportunity for knowledge transfer and networking lies ahead. With everyone’s hopes in us, we make our journey to Paris, where the final leg of the competition awaits… along with our fateful turnout in the 2nd Data Science Game competition.

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date August 27, 2016 No Comments on The Best Laid Schemes, of Spiders and Men! What do entropy, linear programming and Riemann surfaces have in common? Puzzled? Now imagine this connection explained by an eccentric speaker in the attire of a French stage magician, with the charm and virtuosity of a storyteller. Cedric Villani, French mathematician, Fields Medal awardee in the year 2010 and famously called by the NewYorker magazine as the ‘Lady Gaga of Mathematics’ delivered a public lecture titled ‘Of Triangles, Gases, Prices and Men’ at ISI on 26 th August 2016. The second PGDBA batch, currently in its first semester here at ISI, had the opportunity to be present at this intriguing and informative session. Cedric Villani The abstraction and intrigue of Cedric could be assumed from the fact that an introduction to him included a reference to the number of his pets. This abstraction could also be inferred from the title of his talk, which was a play on the title of John Steinbeck’s famous classic ‘Of Mice and Men.’ The first slide of his presentation was taken from Tennyson’s Lady of Shalott. In Cedric’s own interpretation, the Lady of Shalott, accursed to see the world only through a mirror, was actually an allegory to the mathematician forever accursed to look at reality through his equations! Cedric then said that there are many more unsolved mysteries in Mathematics today than there were a hundred years ago. There are ever so many new problems that keep arising. Then there are those age-old ones that lie in famous mathematicians’ lists of unsolved problems. One such famous unproved hypothesis is the Riemann hypothesis. This led Cedric down the path to explaining Riemann’s works and then to the first part of the evening’s presentation – ‘triangles’. He introduced to the audience Riemann surfaces and how Escher employed curved surfaces in his art. As examples of negative curvatures, he showed images of art installations in museums and models of coral reef. Einstein, with the help of his mathematician colleagues, used Riemann’s ideas to develop his General Theory of Relativity. Cedric went on to add that, the GPS technology so ubiquitous in the world today has its roots in Riemann’s works in topology. In a humorous turn of speech, Cedric noted that Riemann was as oblivious to his work being of practical use in 21 st century devices, as modern day GPS users were to Riemann’s surfaces. An ironic symmetry indeed! At this turn of his presentation, Cedric spoke about how it is equally important for scientists to pursue inspiration and not just utility. He marked out Riemann as someone who was particularly interested in approaching problems in his own unique way. Cedric quoted Poincare who had once said, “Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.” The second part of his talk on ‘gases’ started with a description of his visit to Vienna and a search for Boltzmann’s grave. He said that he stopped to ask a family for a map not expecting them to know Boltzmann, let alone his grave. To his surprise, he was not only directed to the location of the grave but the person also exclaimed Boltzmann’s equation of entropy, “S=klogW”! In connection with entropy, he then talked about the Gaussian curve, its ubiquitous nature and its uncanny appearance in many natural systems. He called the study of Probability and Statistics as ‘the extraordinary adventure of mastering of chance.’ As a matter of coincidence, he discussed a famous problem in his presentation called ‘Buffon’s needle’, which was also discussed in class earlier on the same day with the PGDBA students by their lecturer. Experiments such as coin tosses, Cedric said, are best done in the most careless ways! Then he explained how gases are modeled as billiard balls in collision and when there are many such sufficiently small billiard balls, their velocities are accurately modeled as the Gaussian distribution. As a note, Cedric remarked on the power of this distribution by quoting Sir Francis Galton who once called it the ‘supreme law of unreason.’ The next part of his presentation was ‘prices’. Cedric introduced Leonid Kantorovic, the father of linear programming. He explained how math is used to model the optimal allocation of resources. He then strung together ideas from the optimized distribution of resources to the distribution of gas molecules with the least loss of energy. The analogy of prices in linear programming is energy in distribution of gas molecules. This is where Cedric began piecing everything together with the last part of his talk called ‘men’. Cedric described how he had happened to meet his collaborators John Lott and Felix Otto. These men put together the ‘triangles’, ‘gases’ and ‘prices’ and helped Cedric complete his research on how fast gases reach the equilibrium stage described in Boltzmann’s equation. Cedric was awarded the Fields medal in connection with this research. What would have been an intimidating subject matter coming from volumes over volumes of text, was aptly introduced in a two-hour lecture by Cedric Villani, a master at his trade, a storyteller par excellence, a dinosaur catcher in his childhood dreams and a true ambassador of modern mathematics. In a surprising irony of sorts, apart from the many hidden mysteries in the details of his works, the most apparent mystery is the brooches of spiders that he wears on the lapels of his coat! Categories Articles Experiences General The Journey of Identities Post author By pgdba_admin Post date August 14, 2016 No Comments on The Journey of Identities To all those who just joined in. And to all those who couldn’t. I’ve jumped ships. I’ve made the leap. I am now a part of what they call Tata Hall- the luxurious guesthouse at IIM C, when I used to be a part of what they called Himadri (my IIT Delhi hostel). I am convinced that recording my first impressions of this maddening, surreal odyssey that I have set out on will not only prove to be fruitful in retrospect, but in fact help me in retaining my sanity in the present. For those of you who have been wondering what I’m going to blabber about, I would like to give you some context before you abandon me. I am now a student at the PGDBA program. I am comfortably living in my posh suite of the guesthouse of IIM C, with my amazing roommate, situated in Joka, which is nearly thirty kilometers away from the city of Kolkata. There are one hundred and three other students in this program who live with me, so I am sometimes tempted to forget that we are literally in the middle of nowhere. We are being fed an illusion – but an irresistible one that I don’t have the heart to snap out of. In some ways, the fact that the city is beyond my reach is liberating. The five years I spent living in the heart of Delhi, and then another two years in the legendary city of Mumbai, I craved for an escape, for a way out. I think this program has finally answered my call for help. Here, I am constantly told that I am special, that I am the chosen one. The twenty-four years of my life that have led to this moment have made me so cynical that I doubt their belief in me. But at the same time, I greatly value it. After a very long time, I am around people who are willing to invest in my future simply because the three accomplished panel members saw a spark in me, during the twenty-five minutes I spent interviewing for the program. I feel humbled and terrified. The two years ahead are going to demand every inch of me, it is going to consume me, and it is going to change me. But for so long I have felt nothing, that this rush, this constant buzz in my head, this restlessness feels good. I am sleep-deprived, surviving on n number of cups of terribly made tea and coffee and hopping from one assignment to the other with some extended breaks thankfully, and yet, I am alive. How often is it that you are so committed to the moment that every other structure inside and outside your mind breaks form, and this particular moment is all that you can see, all that you can register? This program is one such moment in my life. The program, which aims at producing a team of unparalleled business analysts and data scientists, supposedly the sexiest job in the market these days, has been ideated by the three premiere institutes of India – Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This very credibility generates the “Pygmalion effect” and drives me to excel in the area of analytics. The coming two years make me realize, that I’m far away from the comfort zone and stability that life had offered just before I decided to enroll into PGDBA. But I am also glad that it happened, for I can now appreciate the morning for what it truly represents – a fresh start. I like the concept of this new beginning, for it brings with it the exciting journey of exploring new dimensions and reconstruct your identity. I am tempted to fantasize about the future, but I am trying to contain my excitement to the moment. So many paths seem to call out to me that my brain will explode if I start to think too much. What do I want, you ask? Organized chaos. If you think that is romantically abstract, then you have understood me just a little more than you did before you began to read this note. I will end with a few lines that so perfectly describe my state of mind right now, that I might just marry Robert Frost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. Categories Articles Technical Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge Post author By pgdba_admin Post date January 31, 2016 1 Comment on Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge A brief overview on how I approached a real world healthcare problem via Analytics. Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand.

Tips for Aspirants (1) Go for PGDBA only if you are interested in Mathematics/Statistics and really want to be in data science domain. PGDBA is not a backdoor entrance at IIMC. It is a different program than MBA. (2) Revise 11-12 Mathematics. You can start with basic book like NCERT, but also practice from a JEE main level book (RD Sharma objective book, SK Goyal or Amit M. Agarwal etc. Pick anyone of these.) Do relevant math PYQs from JEE main. (3) For DILR/VARC follow CAT material. Do CAT PYQs. (4) Definitely solve all PGDBA PYQs and take at least 5 full time mock tests. Exam pattern is different than CAT and you need to be accustomed to it.

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 12, 2017 No Comments on What is PGDBA? “Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.” – Geoffrey Moore, Organizational Theorist & Author Analytics: Need of the Hour The amount of data in our world is exploding. As per a McKinsey report, big data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function the same way as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition. The increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media and the Internet of Things will fuel exponential growth in data in the foreseeable future. The rapid pace with which data is being generated across various domains and fields would require people with deep analytical skills to provide insights, enabling companies to gain a competitive edge and offer a better consumer experience. The insights from the data are used for various purposes such as segmentation of customers for better targeting, prediction of churn rate, product recommendation, analysis of customer opinion from media posts, preventive maintenance, management of portfolio risk etc. Untapped potential in India In India, the analytics market is expected to double between 2013 and 2018, reaching a figure of US$ 2.3 billion by 2018, according to a report published by NASSCOM and Blueocean Market Intelligence. This will result in a shortage of about 200,000 data scientists in India over the next few years, according to sources in the Analytics Special Interest Group setup by NASSCOM. Hence, creation of trained industry-ready business analytics professionals is the need of the day. Globally, the demand of data scientists is projected to exceed supply by more than 50% by 2018. To address the paucity of trained workforce in analytics domain, the onus is on the educational institutes to address the needs of the industry. The three institutes IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata are aware of the demand for the well rounded analytics professionals. In order to understand the needs of the industry, a day long conclave was held in January 2015 in IIM Calcutta. Representatives of the leading companies such as KPMG, EXL, Deloitte, LatentView, TCS, Reliance Communication, Deutsche Bank, E&Y, SBI, IBM, Google, Microsoft, HSBC and Cognizant took part in the conclave and based on their inputs, ideas of a specialized course emerged, a course which would produce leaders of the future, skilled in the essential areas of business, statistics and computer science. Through this collaboration between industry and academia, PGDBA was born. Introduction to PGDBA PGDBA is a two year full time residential diploma programme aimed at creating business analytics professionals employable by leading Indian and foreign firms. This programme is designed for those who have an analytical mindset, are interested in tackling challenging business problems, and possess an inclination towards Mathematics. Some of the salient features of the programme include courses taught by reputed faculty members at the campuses of three globally renowned institutes, hands-on business analytics training at a related company, continuous interaction with industry leaders throughout the duration of the programme and the availability of placement opportunities at all the three institutes. The three institutes complement each other to give students the most comprehensive learning of business analytics. The course finds the optimal balance between the theoretical concepts of data science and their applications to business problems. Students get to regularly interact with industry experts through invited talks and guest lectures, where experts talk about the latest trends and challenges in the industry. The course leverages the best of the three institutes in their respective fields of expertise, i.e., Statistics, Technology and Business. In the first semester at ISI, students form a strong base of Mathematical and Statistical concepts. This is followed by a semester at IIT Kharagpur, where students work on data science projects and get to test their statistical concepts built at ISI. This semester is meant to build students’ technical expertise. To complement the first two semesters, students spend their third semester at IIM Calcutta where they are exposed to business problems through case studies and industry interactions. To cap it all, the students get to implement their knowledge in the industry through a six months long internship as their fourth semester. Placements The students from the first two batches of PGDBA experienced highly successful placement processes. Companies from various industries such as BFSI, Consulting, Healthcare, Research, Retail, Gaming, Technology etc. participated and handpicked candidates suitable for both data-driven and business driven analyst roles. The placement processes witnessed the involvement of Fortune 500 companies such as American Express, Walmart Labs, UnitedHealth Group, JPMC, Amazon, Walmart Labs. Some of the job profiles offered were Senior Data Scientist, Analytics Manager, Statistical Analyst, Lead Business Analyst, Solution Analyst, Experienced Associate, Assistant Project Manager. With continuously increasing demand of business analytics professionals, the future of PGDBA looks promising. The unique opportunity of learning from three top-notch institutes of the country is unparalleled by any other Data Analytics course. Recently, PGDBA was ranked 1 by the Analytics India Magazine among the data science courses offered in the country. Stay tuned for more updates Follow us on Facebook Categories About Us What is PGDBA? Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

Categories Articles Chronicles Experiences Foreign Internships: Ambassadors of PGDBA Post author By pgdba_admin Post date November 7, 2016 1 Comment on Foreign Internships: Ambassadors of PGDBA As the founding batch prepares for their final placements, we bring to you a sneak peek into the persona of a unique group of people who are going to cross the borders for their 6-month long internships. Madhur Modi It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds. Here’s a showcase of their profiles: Alok Mani Singh The civil engineer from BHEL, and the “stud” with 4-year worth of experience from a Maharatna PSU and IIT Guwahati attached in his name was the first person who secured his foreign intern in the prestigious Dunia Finance in Dubai. The “Perfect Statistician” as well as the “Management expert” who can solve any problem that comes his way “within a night or two”. He also likes to play guitar and has entertained us for past one and a half years with his pleasant voice. Now he will be working closely with the head of strategic analytics function at Dunia during his 6-month internship in Dubai. Siddhant Sanjeev “Coder” as everyone in the batch knows him to be, was the only other person to impress the company Dunia and accompany Alok to Dubai. Everyone in the batch knows him as a fresher with computer science background from NSIT and a national level coder. He also got himself an interview offer from Google owing to his coding skills as well as won case competitions from PwC and Deloitte. He also developed an e-commerce website using intricate concepts of natural language processing, recommendation systems and information retrieval. Ankitkumar Sonthalia Better known as “Sonthu”, this guy has 3 years of work experience from Cognizant and now he is going to work for Rocket Internet in Myanmar. He has worked on marketing strategy, predictions and recommendation systems. He is a travel enthusiast and has organized many unforgettable trips for our batch. He has also conducted cricket fantasy league and freshers’ party. Rachit Tripathi A mechanical engineer from IIT Kanpur by mind and a quant trader by heart, Rachit bagged an internship in France at QuantCube Technology, a niche fintech company. He’s also part of the team selected for data science game, an international inter-university competition held in Paris. In his pursuit of becoming a quant trader, he obtained CFA level 1 certification and solved various cases from those on Walmart to those on Yahoo data. He is also known as the “data scientist” of the batch and has recently been selected as one of the finalists in Goldman Sachs Quantify competition. Avinash Kumar He is a mechanical engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has worked in L&T for 3 years. He was offered an internship at Rocket Internet which he did not take as he aspired to work in India. He has written an international research paper and also has been part of the Data Science Game with Rachit during this course. He also won NASA systems engineering award while being a B.Tech. student. Besides, he is also a skilled TT player as well as a chess enthusiast. Bharathi Ramaraj Bharathi got the internship offer from Rocket Internet but she decided to stay in India. The only girl to get a foreign internship offer, she is a fresher with B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering. She has worked on uplift modeling, high-frequency data and news analytics and has taken part in various Kaggle competitions. She is also an international chess player and has traveled to as many as 16 countries representing India. She envisions being a financial analyst and to use advanced analytics techniques in a financial credit company to build her career. Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world. Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics. © 2026 PGDBA Blog Powered by WordPress To the top ↑ Up ↑"

I had to explain them the project. There were questions on Joins in SQL (some random sample data and they asked me to get a result). I remember briefly the question. Q1: There were some tickets along with their timestamp (created time stamp). Against each row, there was a column highlighting if the ticket if closed or not. Also, another columns showcasing the time when the ticket was closed. I had to find the maximum time taken by a ticket to get closed. Same for minimum. Also, how many tickets are still not closed? All using joins.Solution: Just do a left join on the ticket id and Mark the condition as closing date greater then opening date. Then calculate the difference in the time stamps (Closing-Open). Then group by functionality can be used to get the results.The discussion on this went for around 10-15 minutesKnowledge about Left Join and Inner Join was sufficient. They also made me write sub nested sub queries. The level was not very difficult. Maths/Stats questions What is correlation? Draw some examples? Basic idea about regression? They made me draw some graphs of some functions. They were bit tricky, but doable. GK/Current Affairs asked (if any) Yes Is the interview stressful?

Why did I use MNF transform instead of a simple PCA during satellite image processing? Maths/Stats questions Since I was a fresher from the space science industry, the first interviewer asked me as to why I wanted to shift from space to business analytics. I replied saying that my interest has shifted towards business analytics when I took electives like deep learning and optimization for operations research. I also mentioned that at the same time, my ‘interest’ and ‘grades’ in electronics subjects were gradually going down. They asked me to model an equation consisting of these two variables, and they also asked me to first answer as to which variable was independent and which was the dependent variable. Initially it took me some time to understand the question during that period I explained as to how these parameters depended on various other factors. Later when I understood their point of view, I answered that interest is an independent variable and grades are a dependent variable as the grades depend on my preparation, my attentiveness in class, etc. The first panelist seemed to be very happy with my response and handed over the baton to the second panelist, who asked me questions about my internship which was based on satellite data analysis. GK/Current Affairs asked (if any) The third panelist asked me questions related to my hobby and was upset to see that I had written just three sentences for the given three blanks. He mentioned that everyone has written very short replies to hobbies. I described all the sentences in detail and they asked me about the different kinds of books I read, followed by questions about my other hobby which was teaching the lesser privileged kids. They asked me questions as to what I taught and which grade of students I taught. That shifted to languages when I mentioned that I sometimes teach in the native mother tongue so as to drive my point home and make the students understand more clearly. My next question was what are the official languages of Andhra Pradesh and then I was asked about languages of Kashmir. I took a wild guess, and also told them it was a guess. Everybody just laughed and a few guesses turned to be right while a few of them were wrong. Is the interview stressful? No Tips for Written Exam Math is the most important section. I think 11th and 12th NCERT math would be the best place to start and brush up basics and later go on to practicing advanced math problems. Data interpretation and logical reasoning are pretty straight forward, and easy to solve. Going through last year question papers would be highly beneficial as a certain trend can be observed in the question paper pattern and one can prepare accordingly. Tips to fill Application Form This is very important, especially for freshers because all the questions in the interview are going to revolve around whatever has been written in the application form. Do not forget to mention any relevant projects since they will add an edge to your profile and the interviewers can ask questions related to those projects as freshers will not have any work experience. Also fill in the hobbies section carefully and thoroughly. Personal Interview I went through the interviews of previous years and made a list of topics to study and go through. But at the end of the day, I’ve been asked questions only based on whatever I have filled in the interview application form. I think its best to be authentic and candid throughout the interview process. Also, one should have a certain clarity as to why they want to pursue this course and how it would be beneficial to them in their future. The panelists are looking for candidates who have a keen interest and passion for business analytics. If they get a feeling that you are genuinely interested and have done your homework in this field, then the chances of converting the interview is very high. Any other interaction post-interview Why business analytics and why not space industry? This has been asked by two panelists. They were probably just surprised, the second panelist realized that I already answered and then he just said congratulations and all the best.

Sitting there all cozy in the 6-9 show of Avenger’s- End Game, the last few moments were surely the emotional roller-coaster. The intense ending of the movie in contrast with the intimation on my selection for the prestigious PGDBA programme made it the quintessential end game. In the amalgamation of a multitude of emotions, there were the elements of concern that made me wonder how the two-year journey would pan out. Having been selected for such a reputed course, I was cognizant of the fact that I would get to meet numerous talents with unparalleled finesse. As today marks the successful one-year completion of my PGDBA journey, I would love to be the raconteur to share an account of my experiences till date. IIMC Bridge Lake IIMC Classroom Mesmerized by the pulchritude of the IIM Calcutta campus, I was all set to traverse the invigorating voyage. In the orientation week, I got acquainted with most of my batch mates and realized the level of diverse expertise each one possessed. It was followed by the ‘ordinary’ classes at IIM, where, every minute seemed like an incessant race against time, all for the quest of managerial acumen. Pre-semester was like a trailer of a fervent flick. In the backdrop of quizzes, case-studies, assignments, and presentations, a funky fresher’s party came like rejuvenation. Organized by our seniors, the soirée provided a platform for showcasing extra-curricular abilities. The parade of variant talents made me acknowledge the multiple prowess, our PGDBA batches owned. With each day that passed by, the hues of pre-sem grew fonder, until the time when it was concluded with a grilling semester exam. Diwali @ISI CD Deshmukh Bhavan @ISI ISI Farewell Birthdays @ISI And in no time, we all were in ISI Kolkata , mecca of Mathematics. The contrast could easily be spotted. Every nook and corner emanated erudite vibes. However, the aura of the institute was pleasant and welcoming. The race here was with knowledge. The devotion and pursuit for learning appeared pristine, which was also shown by the top-notch professors in their readiness to impart wisdom while being compassionate and understanding, enlightening the students in all aspects. With a chunk of peers playing badminton, others peering at them from the top and a few busy with the bulk of assignments, it was at times difficult to decide the activity one really wished to engage in. Apart from juggling between classes and projects, the quest for analytics competence prompted most of us to participate in several Data Science and B-schools competitions, wherein the laudable performances brought laurels to PGDBA. On the social front, be it the magnificence of the Kolkata Durga Puja celebrations, the vigor in Diwali revelry by the entire batch, or just the joy in exploring the city markets, all these would be cherished for life. As the winter winds drew near, the snug yet strenuous ISI semester ended, with a heart-warming farewell and a challenging end-term exam. Main Building @IITKGP Nehru Museum @IITKGP Holi VGSOM Building And soon, with the commencement of the year 2020, we all arrived at the enormous premises of IIT Kharagpur , where the chase was after an efficient time-management. From cycling to the classes to evening strolls to Tech-Market, switching academic buildings between periods to settling into the morning 8 routine while enduring winters, it was quite grueling in essence. In the thick of a bustling semester, the splendor of the Spring Fest, marked by the vibrant live performances and a frolic atmosphere, rolled in like fresh air. This was soon diluted by an enervating mid-semester exam, that seemed boundless. This semester, brimming with tonnes of academic activities, got shadowed, by the swelling plight of the COVID-19 pandemic and as aftermath, it was switched to online mode. As we arrive closer to the completion of this semester, it can be unequivocally opined that this was the most exhausting, yet had its own tunes, to which our rhythms got harmonized. The course is undoubtedly pretty demanding, which sometimes makes you question the worth of all the efforts. But, in the midst of an ongoing semester, when you find the beaming faces and satisfied souls of seniors after securing tremendous placements, where the giants across the country were hell-bent on hiring in a bunch, you realize the influence the power of the triumvirate, the structure of the course and your efforts can create. In a nutshell, the journey so far has been enveloped in vivacity with enlightenment, camaraderie, and a rich set of cultures from all the three institutes, at its very core! — Sugandha Ranjan Post navigation Next Article The mission of PGDBA Previous Article PGDBA Interview Experiences – 2020-22 Related Articles Articles The mission of PGDBA By Anurag Malakar, PGDBA Batch-5 (2019-21) The year 2005 | A regular morning in a middle-class Indian’s life The middle-aged… General FAQs Please go through the official website for the program to answer your basic queries: https://www.iimcal.ac.in/programs/pgdba 1) How do I apply… About Us What is PGDBA? “Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.” -… Articles Wiser By A Semester Of Statistics - Himanshu Goyal The first step is the hardest. - Unknown When one first hears about the PGDBA course, the… This Article Has 3 Comments Madhur Modi June 18, 2020 Reply Truly mesmerizing Shreshth Bhatt July 12, 2020 Reply Ma’am its such a wonderful and an enjoyable experiences you and your fellow mates had …and you really have described it so aptly… Shivam Singh July 27, 2020 Reply I was pretty shy to ask for help regarding this course but after reading this I so want to Can you help me out ?

Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand.

Himanshu Goyal About the author: B. Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering from IIT Delhi – worked in Global Analytics (short-term loan provider in UK) for 5 years within collection analytics and risk analytics teams. There have been a lot of posts around the vision and scope of the program so I am not going to touch upon that for now. Instead, I am going to share my first-hand experience of the events in the first week – the orientation week – and how they affected my perception. Whenever we meet a stranger, we need an icebreaker to get things started. And that was the way the orientation week was designed. If there is one thing that repeatedly gets focussed on here at IIM-C, it is that you need to build your network. I had a fair deal of interactions with various groups. There were sessions with Deans, Program Founders, Professors, Seniors and last but not the least, multiple industry leaders. The sessions were designed to make the students more aware of the program, in terms of what the students should expect from it as well as what the professors and industries expected from its graduates. Not only did these sessions made me more informed, but I also learnt a few concepts in this week itself before the classes had even started! Interaction with Professors : There were multiple types of interactions with professors. In one of them, Deans and Senior Professors of the three institutes talked about the genesis of the program and how the geography of the three institutes fitted in perfectly to start it. It was heart-warming to see how each of them would compliment each other’s institution when their own was one of the best in its field. In another session, professors of the Organisational Behaviour course conducted a class exercise – Lost@C. While I won’t go into what it was, it would suffice to say that it was not only fun, but it also made me think on how to work better as a team. A session on how to solve case studies was organised as well. It was a very interactive session and I was encouraged to think and ask questions. All said and done, that my next 2 years were in the hands of capable professors. Interaction with Seniors : This was something each one of my batch was looking forward to. All of us had come from different backgrounds and we had questions – a significant number of them. The interaction started with introductions from both the batches. It then shifted to academic structure, the life at different campuses and the opportunities in the industry. There were a bunch of fundas from their end out of which I don’t remember much; but the key takeaway for me was that there is a huge demand in the industry for people having the right blend of technical skills and business acumen and this course perfectly bridges that gap. A large number of people have their eyes on how first few batches are performing and hence it will be up to us on how much we can push ourselves because the opportunity to gain knowledge in the three institutes is endless. Interaction with Industries : Companies were indeed looking forward to interact which was evident in the first week itself. Among them were – LatentView, PWC, KPMG, Deloitte and few others. What was striking to see was that despite belonging to diverse backgrounds, all of them had same expectations – the graduates from this course will be able to solve crucial business problems using data which will be analysed through various machine learning processes. Each of the companies highlighted the need for data scientists in today’s world because of the amount of data being generated and how it can be filled with us if we have the right mindset. It was also heartening to know that machine learning was now being applied to almost every domain (even agriculture); one just has to have an inquisitive mind to ask the right questions. I clearly remember a quote from one of such sessions, “Size of data is not the thing, but what you do with it.” Orientation day @ISI: As part of the orientation program, we also spent one day at ISI Kolkata and interacted with the professors there. At first look, ISI is an unassuming college (specially after going from IIM which has 7 lakes inside its campus!!). However, it is second to none when it comes to the faculty. One can easily find that each of the faculty is a gem by going through their profile and I cannot possible complete this article without mentioning Prof. Bimal Roy – A Padma Shri awardee, Master Cryptologist, Ex-Director at ISI – it can go on and on. He took a brief session and shared his personal experiences related to analytics. His way of telling stories really connected with me. He added a new dimension of problem solving techniques in my mind in that short session itself. . I already knew that ISI was going to play a unique role in this program because of its unparalleled specialisation in statistics and the one day spent there made me even more excited to start my studies. Given that the program is in its development stage, I had made a conscious choice and took a leap of faith while deciding to join the course. I had belief in the system, but was still apprehensive about industry expectations, and how will the institutes coordinate among themselves. These interactions, in one way or another, not only helped in soothing down my nerves but also made me even more excited and motivated to do well and make this program a success. As Abraham Lincoln once said, The best way to predict your future is to create it .

And to all those who couldn’t. I’ve jumped ships. I’ve made the leap. I am now a part of what they call Tata Hall- the luxurious guesthouse at IIM C, when I used to be a part of what they called Himadri (my IIT Delhi hostel). I am convinced that recording my first impressions of this maddening, surreal odyssey that I have set out on will not only prove to be fruitful in retrospect, but in fact help me in retaining my sanity in the present. For those of you who have been wondering what I’m going to blabber about, I would like to give you some context before you abandon me. I am now a student at the PGDBA program. I am comfortably living in my posh suite of the guesthouse of IIM C, with my amazing roommate, situated in Joka, which is nearly thirty kilometers away from the city of Kolkata. There are one hundred and three other students in this program who live with me, so I am sometimes tempted to forget that we are literally in the middle of nowhere. We are being fed an illusion – but an irresistible one that I don’t have the heart to snap out of. In some ways, the fact that the city is beyond my reach is liberating. The five years I spent living in the heart of Delhi, and then another two years in the legendary city of Mumbai, I craved for an escape, for a way out. I think this program has finally answered my call for help. Here, I am constantly told that I am special, that I am the chosen one. The twenty-four years of my life that have led to this moment have made me so cynical that I doubt their belief in me. But at the same time, I greatly value it. After a very long time, I am around people who are willing to invest in my future simply because the three accomplished panel members saw a spark in me, during the twenty-five minutes I spent interviewing for the program. I feel humbled and terrified. The two years ahead are going to demand every inch of me, it is going to consume me, and it is going to change me. But for so long I have felt nothing, that this rush, this constant buzz in my head, this restlessness feels good. I am sleep-deprived, surviving on n number of cups of terribly made tea and coffee and hopping from one assignment to the other with some extended breaks thankfully, and yet, I am alive. How often is it that you are so committed to the moment that every other structure inside and outside your mind breaks form, and this particular moment is all that you can see, all that you can register? This program is one such moment in my life. The program, which aims at producing a team of unparalleled business analysts and data scientists, supposedly the sexiest job in the market these days, has been ideated by the three premiere institutes of India – Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This very credibility generates the “Pygmalion effect” and drives me to excel in the area of analytics. The coming two years make me realize, that I’m far away from the comfort zone and stability that life had offered just before I decided to enroll into PGDBA. But I am also glad that it happened, for I can now appreciate the morning for what it truly represents – a fresh start. I like the concept of this new beginning, for it brings with it the exciting journey of exploring new dimensions and reconstruct your identity. I am tempted to fantasize about the future, but I am trying to contain my excitement to the moment. So many paths seem to call out to me that my brain will explode if I start to think too much. What do I want, you ask? Organized chaos. If you think that is romantically abstract, then you have understood me just a little more than you did before you began to read this note. I will end with a few lines that so perfectly describe my state of mind right now, that I might just marry Robert Frost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

The classes were held initially at the Kolmogorov bhavan. Within a month we were given our own classroom in the Satyendra Nath Bose Bhavan. Kolmogorov bhavan, ISI Our curriculum consisted of 5 subjects. The subjects and the professors involved were: Statistical inference – Amitava Banerjee Stochastic processes – Dr. Bimal Roy & Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta Computing for data sciences – Dr. Sourav Sengupta Statistical structures in data – Debashish Sengupta Database Management Systems – Dr. Pinakpani Pal & Amiya Das By far the stars of the course were the faculty members. It was an honour to interact with a Padma Shree awardee in Dr. Bimal Roy. To be taught on a regular basis by such an esteemed personality was slightly overwhelming and hugely enriching. The sheer brilliance of the man and his way of looking at probability and its applications was an experience difficult to pen down. Dr. Kishan Chand Gupta shared the course and taught Markov Chains. Satyendra Nath bhavan , ISI Campus Diligent and sincere, Prof. Debashish Sengupta was the ideal teacher. He covered every topic rigorously starting right with the basics of statistics to the highly complex multivariate analysis. What seemed an easy course initially, became heavily loaded and among the toughest by the time the course came to its completion. Tutorials were held every week to discuss exercise problems. The jovial Prof. Amitava Banerjee taught us the habit of drawing meaningful inferences out of large volumes of data. Drawing from his vast pool of consultancy experience, he inculcated in us the ability to convert real life business problems into statistical problems. His assignments involved working on datasets and testing hypothesis in the correct way. Dr. Pinakpani Pal was interactive, and worked hard to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. His course had 2 parts: the theoretical knowledge of databases, and a hands-on SQL application. He shared the course with Amiya Das, a seasoned professional at Oracle. The friendly and ever enthusiastic Dr Sourav Sengupta was always approachable and motivated the entire batch in getting accustomed with highly complex ideas. His passion for teaching shone through as he went through the concepts of linear algebra and machine learning algorithms. He organised the course superbly and the web page for his course was among the best resource repositories we could have hoped for. The invited lectures were top drawer, with experienced professionals coming in to share their insights and recommendations about the field of analytics. Overall the first semester was a learning experience beyond compare and laid a solid foundation on which we can build in our journey towards becoming well-rounded data scientists.

PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand.

December 18, 2015 pgdba_admin Campus Life 5 Comments Here comes our atta boy, our cheerful Madhur Modi to speak about our first semester at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. He is a CS grad, tinted with the experience of working in Acrobat Team, Adobe, India for 11 months. Let’s hear what Madhur says! After a not-so long orientation and pre-semester at IIM C, it was time to move to ISI. All of us were already feeling the attachment we had built with each other and formed the spirit of ‘joka tribe’ within ourselves. We started our journey to learn and started packing… but we were not done with the pre-semester yet! 🙂 Not before we can have a last photo-session! Even the journey to ISI was an insightful one! Filled with discussions of memories made within the short month. Happy faces! I remember us all at the peak of our enthusiasm when we visited ISI for the first time after the orientation, this time for around 6 months with knowledge imparted from renowned teachers. Since each of us had opted for the hostel facilities, the registration day was spent in lodging and document formalities. It all began with 5 subjects, 8 teachers and 51 students – daily two hour classes, twice daily where a moment of flickering attention meant you’ll lose the ability to grasp anything for the rest of the class. Yes! We had teachers who could teach us their subject continuously for two hours and every moment… each of them they made us wonder how amazing it is to learn in an enjoyable fashion. We all felt so comfortable moving from our 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional minds to nth dimensions and then move down using multidimensional scaling ☺ ☺ (was I too technical here? Come to ISI and you’ll know what I mean). I bet all our teachers from ISI would be laughing reading the joke here. By the ways, if you’re writing about ISI, it won’t be a just article if you do not mention each teacher separately! Starting from our class teacher and DBMS teacher prof. Pinakpani Pal, it was him who would come to our rescue each time, whether it is to change the mess, requirement of any additional facilities, aid in any procedures or help regarding the subject. He would kindly reach out his hand and solve all our problems in a flick. DBMS was also taught by prof. Amiya and prof. Dilip who would take care of SQL teaching for us. Thanks to him, DBMS was one of the most comfortable subjects in ISI. I still remember the fact that 44 teachers have bhattacharya awards in their name! We all used to marvel at the level of knowledge at ISI, rather, we felt grateful to our teachers for feeding such golden nuggets of information to us daily and Prof. Debasis is the teacher who’s teaching reminded us the reasons they won those awards. I always felt that he teaches one subject but I learned things anyone would consider is worth much more! From histograms, scatter plots, distributions and tests for distributions, he took us to bivariate and the multivariate analysis followed by more tests and feature selection. Moreover, he took extra classes and doubt sessions every week just to ensure that when we learn, we learn well When you start talking about the teachers, each teacher is better than the other! We had Statistical Probabilistic Analysis taught by two teachers, Prof. Bimal and Prof. Kishan. It was the only subject with no assignments, since probability has such a wide scope. This class was all practical, we were given real life examples and applied concepts to solve them. There was yet another similar subject, inference, taught by Prof. Amitava which encompassed all other subjects and drew inference tests from each of them, filled with more real life examples. We had one more course, or rather, set of course ☺ Computing in data science taught by Prof. Saurav Sengupta. I could proudly say to those non-cse students who fear how they would learn programming techniques- this is the course that will help you make your first transition. From practically negligible knowledge, this course taught us not just R and Python, but also made us do an entire team project to deep seat the lessons in our hearts. The best thing? We had fun! I would frequently visit the course website and our project blog and proudly say that we have come far, far from where we were when we entered ISI. P.S. do check out the blog of group 1 authored by our group. 🙂 Didn’t I mention anything else besides studies? How forgetful of me! ISI is a place of happenings! Every other day there were announcements of workshops in various fields of statistics and there were a variety of activities which would now be sweet memories for us with ISI. We flew kites, we had birthday parties, we played games and we had our first formal photoshoot! Looking smart! ISI also had a very special memory… Diwali! What’s that? How did we celebrate it? I could boast that it was better than any student had celebrated while at college! Two of our batchmates, Mr. Avinash (a.k.a. Gandhi) and Mukul cleaned their room and turned it into the Pooja venue (see photos in link) We made diyas, did Pooja, sang bhakti songs, distributed Prasad and made rangoli ! We burnt a few crackers and all our rooms illuminated with the auspiciousness on that day! It was one of the best Diwali celebrations of my life! Diwali! Soon after Durga puja, Diwali and Kali puja, we had our final exams and had to say “Bye Bye ISI” I am thankful that our first semester was conducted at ISI where we learnt such a great deal and progressed so far ahead in our skills. It already feels like we can do most of business analytics even though we have ways to go. How could be go away without saying a delightful adios to our Indian Statistical institute? We requested all the teachers to come for a final photoshoot session. Besides one photo present in CDS website , another photo from the last day would mark a fitting ending to our memories and knowledge lending roller coaster ride at the pillar of statistical, mathematical and machine learning institute!

Could you please tell me what to expect in interview from your experience as i have around 2 months to prepare for it. Madhur Modi January 20, 2016 Reply At this point, do focus on the written test first. You should again be prepared with mathematics for the interview as well. Most of the other questions besides maths are similar to a typical IIM interview. You will need to prepare additional topics as well such as probability and differentiation. Based on your profile, some specific questions might be asked. Also, stay tuned for future posts on the blog where we may post further insights!

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material?

Himanshu Goyal About the author: B. Tech. in Production and Industrial Engineering from IIT Delhi – worked in Global Analytics (short-term loan provider in UK) for 5 years within collection analytics and risk analytics teams. There have been a lot of posts around the vision and scope of the program so I am not going to touch upon that for now. Instead, I am going to share my first-hand experience of the events in the first week – the orientation week – and how they affected my perception. Whenever we meet a stranger, we need an icebreaker to get things started. And that was the way the orientation week was designed. If there is one thing that repeatedly gets focussed on here at IIM-C, it is that you need to build your network. I had a fair deal of interactions with various groups. There were sessions with Deans, Program Founders, Professors, Seniors and last but not the least, multiple industry leaders. The sessions were designed to make the students more aware of the program, in terms of what the students should expect from it as well as what the professors and industries expected from its graduates. Not only did these sessions made me more informed, but I also learnt a few concepts in this week itself before the classes had even started! Interaction with Professors : There were multiple types of interactions with professors. In one of them, Deans and Senior Professors of the three institutes talked about the genesis of the program and how the geography of the three institutes fitted in perfectly to start it. It was heart-warming to see how each of them would compliment each other’s institution when their own was one of the best in its field. In another session, professors of the Organisational Behaviour course conducted a class exercise – Lost@C. While I won’t go into what it was, it would suffice to say that it was not only fun, but it also made me think on how to work better as a team. A session on how to solve case studies was organised as well. It was a very interactive session and I was encouraged to think and ask questions. All said and done, that my next 2 years were in the hands of capable professors. Interaction with Seniors : This was something each one of my batch was looking forward to. All of us had come from different backgrounds and we had questions – a significant number of them. The interaction started with introductions from both the batches. It then shifted to academic structure, the life at different campuses and the opportunities in the industry. There were a bunch of fundas from their end out of which I don’t remember much; but the key takeaway for me was that there is a huge demand in the industry for people having the right blend of technical skills and business acumen and this course perfectly bridges that gap. A large number of people have their eyes on how first few batches are performing and hence it will be up to us on how much we can push ourselves because the opportunity to gain knowledge in the three institutes is endless. Interaction with Industries : Companies were indeed looking forward to interact which was evident in the first week itself. Among them were – LatentView, PWC, KPMG, Deloitte and few others. What was striking to see was that despite belonging to diverse backgrounds, all of them had same expectations – the graduates from this course will be able to solve crucial business problems using data which will be analysed through various machine learning processes. Each of the companies highlighted the need for data scientists in today’s world because of the amount of data being generated and how it can be filled with us if we have the right mindset. It was also heartening to know that machine learning was now being applied to almost every domain (even agriculture); one just has to have an inquisitive mind to ask the right questions. I clearly remember a quote from one of such sessions, “Size of data is not the thing, but what you do with it.” Orientation day @ISI: As part of the orientation program, we also spent one day at ISI Kolkata and interacted with the professors there. At first look, ISI is an unassuming college (specially after going from IIM which has 7 lakes inside its campus!!). However, it is second to none when it comes to the faculty. One can easily find that each of the faculty is a gem by going through their profile and I cannot possible complete this article without mentioning Prof. Bimal Roy – A Padma Shri awardee, Master Cryptologist, Ex-Director at ISI – it can go on and on. He took a brief session and shared his personal experiences related to analytics. His way of telling stories really connected with me. He added a new dimension of problem solving techniques in my mind in that short session itself. . I already knew that ISI was going to play a unique role in this program because of its unparalleled specialisation in statistics and the one day spent there made me even more excited to start my studies. Given that the program is in its development stage, I had made a conscious choice and took a leap of faith while deciding to join the course. I had belief in the system, but was still apprehensive about industry expectations, and how will the institutes coordinate among themselves. These interactions, in one way or another, not only helped in soothing down my nerves but also made me even more excited and motivated to do well and make this program a success. As Abraham Lincoln once said, The best way to predict your future is to create it .

It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day. The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later. The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips! In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch. That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse. As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

Robin Singh Disclaimer : I have tried to restrict technicalities to a minimum in the blog, so as to cater to a wider segment of readers. However, a little awareness about machine learning will make the rest of the post even more comprehensible and hopefully exciting. The healthcare industry is not only huge but also has a tremendous potential for the use of technology and data science. In this post, I will share one of the numerous instances of the use of unconventional analytics to engineer solutions in response to challenges in the field of healthcare. This seemingly complex idea, can be structured and implemented by a combination of machine learning tools and data crunching techniques. The solution proposed here is designed to work with critical patient data in hospitals and raise an alarm when the state of the patient degrades, eventually leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Now the obvious questions, How will such a system help? Can the doctors not monitor patient state physically? Well, it is only possible for a doctor to physically monitor a small number of patients. What if the number of patients is large?. Also, the decision to provide intensive care to patient after an alarm has been raised has monetary and human life impacts. If the alarm can be raised in time, intensive care although expensive, can be provided to the patient. At the backend, the model can be seen as a typical classification machine learning problem . Classification, as the name suggests is a method to categorize data points into predetermined target groups. Numerous algorithms can do classification like Bayesian model, decision tree, random forest, regression etc. We used Random Forest model for the current data set, due to simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the classification method happened to be only the tip of the iceberg. There were many unforeseen challenges – primarily due to data coming from the healthcare domain and also computational resource constraints. First, healthcare data is highly erratic and the severity of a measurement varies from person to person. For example, a certain value of a respiratory measurement can be dangerous and life risking for a normal person but normal for a smoker. This poses a fundamental challenge to the accuracy of models built on the healthcare data. Second, the state to be predicted is different from the state whose training data is available. This is slightly difficult to grasp, but lets try. We want to raise an alarm when the patient’s situation is worsening from normal and approaching mortality but still the patient has time. However, the training dataset has information on the actual mortality/no-mortality. Using the training data to learn will imply making an approximation. The third challenge comes from implementation aspects. The prediction of no-mortality should be highly reliable as compared to prediction of mortality. The system should be able to predict the no-mortality situations with an accuracy of 99% or above. Accuracy in no-mortality and mortality have a trade-off and hence if we tune the model for high accuracy in no-mortality then the accuracy on mortality is low. Let’s take a moment to think about the methodology again. What can we observe? The predictive model seems to be replicating logic similar to a real doctor. In fact, the very idea of machine learning is to train the machines to apply logic like human beings do. For example, using the past data to learn and take decisions in the future cases, considering trade-offs originating from the decision making process and using the concept of information value to take decision. Discussed above is one example on the use of analytics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare scenario. There are many unexplored applications in the domain, a huge scope for improvement in the existing models and unquantifiable amount of data to process. In the coming years devices based on such models will be a reality and the industry requires many more analyst to cater to the demand. Tags Analytics , Data Sciences , Healthcare Analytics , PGDBA Categories Articles Technical A Record, a Code and Twitter Post author By pgdba_admin Post date January 20, 2016 3 Comments on A Record, a Code and Twitter How my first machine learning model was validated by a goal scored a continent away. Ritwik Moghe It was the twenty-eighth day of November 2015. As the strangely balmy day yawned, stretched and gratefully gave way to dusk, several eyes were glued to the actions of one man. The man was slight, had strange spiky hair and a face that might remind many of all those ‘dawgs’ or ‘dealers’ from Breaking Bad. Only a year back, hardly anyone knew of his existence. And today, he was about to etch his name in the annals of footballing history. As he latched on to a pitch perfect through-ball that split the Manchester United defense in half and slotted it in past the oncoming goalkeeper, several things exploded. One of those was the voice of the legendary Martin Tyler as he shouted “Vardy! Its Eleven, it’s Heaven for Jamie Vardy” ( The goal as it unfolded ). Jamie Vardy, a name most of you might still be unfamiliar with, had broken the English Premier League Record of scoring goals in most number of consecutive matches. He had scored in each of the past eleven games. In the grand scheme of things, the record, in itself might not be much significance. What mattered more was Vardy’s story. From an amateur player with no ‘proper’ training or facilities and very humble beginnings, he had risen to be the most prolific striker in one of the most competitive leagues around the world. It was a classic fairy-tale. For several amateurs trudging every evening into those muddy football fields and trying to curl it like Carlos, Vardy was hope. So as he was being engulfed by his team-mates after he had scored that crucial record-breaking goal, Vardy was causing another explosion around the world. It was an explosion of hope, of greetings and of admiration. And sitting in our dorm rooms overlooking the ponderous Barrackpore Trunk Road in the quaint campus of ISI Calcutta, a bunch of us fledgling data-scientists of PGDBA captured this joyous explosion. We captured it using Twitter. A graph encapsulating the positive Twitter sentiment about Vardy right after THE GOAL! The problem that we were working on was Opinion Mining through tweets. Billions of tweets are posted every day. These tweets reflect the opinions or sentiments of the users about various topics. For instance, a tweet like “I love Apple #Iphone6” might reflect the user’s positive sentiment about the company Apple. A study of several such tweets about a particular subject or company can provide valuable insights to the company about the general public opinion about themselves. We were analyzing the Twitter sentiment about various current and upcoming football stars. Our aim was to identify the next big star, the one who would eclipse Messi and attain the ultimate pinnacle of fame by someday being the brand ambassador of Tata Motors! Our observation about Vardy and his big day was a mere microcosm of a bigger project where we analyzed over one million tweets about 10 players obtained over a period of one month. The analysis began with mining tweets about the particular players. The tweets were obtained from an API using Python. Relevant meta-data like the location of the user and the time-stamp of the tweet was extracted along with the text of the tweet. The text of the tweet was then converted into a Term-Document Frequency Matrix (TDF). Now only a year ago, all that I could I have thought of on hearing ‘Term-Document Frequency Matrix’ would have been Neo in his slick glasses staring into some green numbers floating Chinese-style on an antique nineties monitor! But TDF is way simpler than that. All it does is that it creates a table. Each row is a tweet. All the words observed in all the tweets that we are studying make up the columns. Consider this example for clarity- Thus each word is now a feature and each tweet a data-point. We then used a Machine Learning technique called Maximum Entropy Classifier in R to classify each tweet or data-point into one of the three categories: Positive, Neutral or Negative. (I could get into the details of the work, about why we went for supervised classification approach, about why MaxEnt works best for Text Classification etc. But since I’m trying to make this article tractable for someone with no prior analytics experience I stop by providing a link to another blog about our detailed work. ( A detailed report of our project ) Now this process was carried out for all the tweets about all the different players. The prevalent sentiment about a particular player was given by the difference between the number of positive and negative tweets (which was also normalized). Doing this helped us observe several interesting trends in the data. Consider the comparative study of sentiments about Neymar, Ronaldo and Harry Kane over November 2015. Also, have a look at how the sentiment about Harry Kane varied across countries. Such analysis has huge potential applications. Imagine how Tottenham Hotspurs, the club which Harry Kane plays for could maximize their profits by opening more ‘Spurs Stores’ in South Africa where Kane is way more popular (green) as compared to say Australia where he is clearly notorious (red). Are you an executive at EA Sports and want to decide whom to have on the cover of FIFA 16? Just mine sentiment on twitter and viola, you’ll see that Neymar would be a way better choice than Kane. So this was all about our project on Twitter sentiment about football superstars. This project was a part of our course called Computing for Data Sciences at ISI Kolkata. All of our fellow mates from PGDBA have also worked on several such (hopefully: P) interesting projects. Some of them will share their stories with you on this blog as well. Vardy and his record holds a special place in our hearts. He was the perfect muse for demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. When you’ve come up with your first ‘Real’ model, the true test of the model happens when you see it work in real life on a completely unexpected scale. That meteoric rise in Vardy’s sentiment at 5.55 pm BST, right after he had scored the crucial goal proved to us beyond doubt that our model worked! So, I sign off with a link to that moment when Vardy smashed a record, the moment when people around the world celebrated the dawn of a new star, and the moment when our model was validated! Cheers!

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program. Tags Analytics , PGDBA , placements , students Categories About Us What is PGDBA? Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 3, 2015 2 Comments on What is PGDBA? PGDBA stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics. To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

And to all those who couldn’t. I’ve jumped ships. I’ve made the leap. I am now a part of what they call Tata Hall- the luxurious guesthouse at IIM C, when I used to be a part of what they called Himadri (my IIT Delhi hostel). I am convinced that recording my first impressions of this maddening, surreal odyssey that I have set out on will not only prove to be fruitful in retrospect, but in fact help me in retaining my sanity in the present. For those of you who have been wondering what I’m going to blabber about, I would like to give you some context before you abandon me. I am now a student at the PGDBA program. I am comfortably living in my posh suite of the guesthouse of IIM C, with my amazing roommate, situated in Joka, which is nearly thirty kilometers away from the city of Kolkata. There are one hundred and three other students in this program who live with me, so I am sometimes tempted to forget that we are literally in the middle of nowhere. We are being fed an illusion – but an irresistible one that I don’t have the heart to snap out of. In some ways, the fact that the city is beyond my reach is liberating. The five years I spent living in the heart of Delhi, and then another two years in the legendary city of Mumbai, I craved for an escape, for a way out. I think this program has finally answered my call for help. Here, I am constantly told that I am special, that I am the chosen one. The twenty-four years of my life that have led to this moment have made me so cynical that I doubt their belief in me. But at the same time, I greatly value it. After a very long time, I am around people who are willing to invest in my future simply because the three accomplished panel members saw a spark in me, during the twenty-five minutes I spent interviewing for the program. I feel humbled and terrified. The two years ahead are going to demand every inch of me, it is going to consume me, and it is going to change me. But for so long I have felt nothing, that this rush, this constant buzz in my head, this restlessness feels good. I am sleep-deprived, surviving on n number of cups of terribly made tea and coffee and hopping from one assignment to the other with some extended breaks thankfully, and yet, I am alive. How often is it that you are so committed to the moment that every other structure inside and outside your mind breaks form, and this particular moment is all that you can see, all that you can register? This program is one such moment in my life. The program, which aims at producing a team of unparalleled business analysts and data scientists, supposedly the sexiest job in the market these days, has been ideated by the three premiere institutes of India – Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This very credibility generates the “Pygmalion effect” and drives me to excel in the area of analytics. The coming two years make me realize, that I’m far away from the comfort zone and stability that life had offered just before I decided to enroll into PGDBA. But I am also glad that it happened, for I can now appreciate the morning for what it truly represents – a fresh start. I like the concept of this new beginning, for it brings with it the exciting journey of exploring new dimensions and reconstruct your identity. I am tempted to fantasize about the future, but I am trying to contain my excitement to the moment. So many paths seem to call out to me that my brain will explode if I start to think too much. What do I want, you ask? Organized chaos. If you think that is romantically abstract, then you have understood me just a little more than you did before you began to read this note. I will end with a few lines that so perfectly describe my state of mind right now, that I might just marry Robert Frost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. ← Analytics in Healthcare – Xerox Challenge → The Best Laid Schemes, of Spiders and Men!

Well, to be very honest, even we don’t know it. We can just anticipate and hope that it turns out to be better than our expectations. I will share my experience so far, which makes me believe that placements and internships are going to be no less than PGDM (of IIM C) or any other Masters course at any of the three institutes. The companies who are expected to recruit PGDBA students are going to be same bunch of companies who recruit MBA students. There are lots of companies who hire MBAs for analytics role. Now, since PGDBA program aims at bridging this gap, I feel that packages offered would be similar to the ones offered to PGDM students. So far, the companies that hav e interacted with us are Microsoft, SAS, SBI, Deloitte, TCS, IBM, Flipkart, Reliance, American Express, BPCL, Latent View and few other start-ups. (I might be missing out few names). All the companies mentioned here have shown interest in hiring students for internships. Moreover, as per my discussion with the Chairman of this program, there are few other companies which have shown keen interest in hiring students (not disclosing the names, but these are the biggest e-commerce, I-Banks and Consulting firms). It is expected that few of these companies might teach us few courses in the upcoming semesters. Considering the uptake of analytics in companies and PGDBA being the only full-time residential program (of such stature), demand is going to be very high. So, the hopes are very high and I am quite confident that these are going to be met. P.S. – All the views expressed on this blog are made by students and have nothing to do with any faculty, college or any official involved in the program.

Actually i am instrument engineer with two years of work ex in manufacturing, i am interested in pursuing pgdba course. My query is: Does it provide an edge if u r from Computer science background or with work experience in analytics? Thank you Reply Maunish Shah says: December 22, 2015 at 10:12 am Having the same profile and very much interested in mathematics though i have not given Olympiad or the exams like that in school time because of less awareness about that exams.Fees are around 17L should i go for it? Reply pgdbaunofficial says: December 16, 2015 at 7:50 am There might be some advantage if you are from CS background because you need to study Database, SQL, Languages (Python/Java). But I would say that is not a deal breaker. The level of expertise that is required in these areas can be easily built during the course. Reply By Post Author sarthak aggarwal says: December 29, 2015 at 4:21 am sir, Do they prefer to admit candidates with cs background or wd work ex in analytics during admission in pgdba. Actually read about the batch profile, it seems like they admit candidates with very bright academic background. thank you Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:19 am There is no preference whatsoever to any background, be it cs background or people with work ex in analytics (judging from the fact that the number is not high in the current batch). About the academic backgrounds, every student has his/her own diversity and even though it may seem the same as you inferred, we’re all normal students just like anyone else (with a strong affinity for analytics, that is) Reply Mbs says: January 1, 2016 at 10:46 am What could be the question paper pattern for the written test for the batch of 2016-2018 Reply ankit gupta says: January 12, 2016 at 7:39 am can anyone plz provide links for PGDBA preparation material? Reply Venkatesh says: January 16, 2016 at 9:17 am Can you please provide me sample questions paper for written test ?? Reply Madhur Modi says: January 18, 2016 at 6:36 am For the preparation material/ sample questions or pattern, There have been no official announcements in this regard and the separate test is being conducted for the first time. So going through the concepts mentioned in the syllabus on the website from any standard resource (make sure they are well seated in your mind) should be enough, As such, I’m sure such details are all unintended shrouded mystery by the conveners and would be revealed only on the test day. There have been many speculations about the tests and you can find some posts on pagal guy ( http://www.pagalguy.com/discussions/2016-2018-pgdba-iimc-iit-kgp-isi-preparation-discussion-feedback-33185469?utm_source=notificationsemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=notificationsemail&utm_content=2 ) links as well. Reply Hardik Agarwal says: March 27, 2016 at 12:44 pm URGENT : If I don’t have an important document that has to be shown during the interview process in original (as said in the call letter), can I show its copy and give an undertaking of that? Will it work or will they cancel my candidature? Thanks in advance. Reply Madhur Modi says: April 20, 2016 at 10:04 am The interviews are already over. I think you would have already received the instructions from the panel about this Reply subhodeep says: April 19, 2016 at 10:28 am hi, i converted my PGDBA call. i am looking forward to join this course and very optimistic about it. just need to convince myself that avg salary will be equivalent to PGDM of IIMC. how is the industry perceiving this course. are companies like BCG and MCG lined up for PGDBA? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:00 pm Hi.. did you join the course?? Reply abhaydeepiws1 says: November 1, 2016 at 2:01 pm What was last year’s cut-off to get the admissions?

Post author By pgdba_admin Post date December 12, 2017 No Comments on What is PGDBA? “Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.” – Geoffrey Moore, Organizational Theorist & Author Analytics: Need of the Hour The amount of data in our world is exploding. As per a McKinsey report, big data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function the same way as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition. The increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media and the Internet of Things will fuel exponential growth in data in the foreseeable future. The rapid pace with which data is being generated across various domains and fields would require people with deep analytical skills to provide insights, enabling companies to gain a competitive edge and offer a better consumer experience. The insights from the data are used for various purposes such as segmentation of customers for better targeting, prediction of churn rate, product recommendation, analysis of customer opinion from media posts, preventive maintenance, management of portfolio risk etc. Untapped potential in India In India, the analytics market is expected to double between 2013 and 2018, reaching a figure of US$ 2.3 billion by 2018, according to a report published by NASSCOM and Blueocean Market Intelligence. This will result in a shortage of about 200,000 data scientists in India over the next few years, according to sources in the Analytics Special Interest Group setup by NASSCOM. Hence, creation of trained industry-ready business analytics professionals is the need of the day. Globally, the demand of data scientists is projected to exceed supply by more than 50% by 2018. To address the paucity of trained workforce in analytics domain, the onus is on the educational institutes to address the needs of the industry. The three institutes IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata are aware of the demand for the well rounded analytics professionals. In order to understand the needs of the industry, a day long conclave was held in January 2015 in IIM Calcutta. Representatives of the leading companies such as KPMG, EXL, Deloitte, LatentView, TCS, Reliance Communication, Deutsche Bank, E&Y, SBI, IBM, Google, Microsoft, HSBC and Cognizant took part in the conclave and based on their inputs, ideas of a specialized course emerged, a course which would produce leaders of the future, skilled in the essential areas of business, statistics and computer science. Through this collaboration between industry and academia, PGDBA was born. Introduction to PGDBA PGDBA is a two year full time residential diploma programme aimed at creating business analytics professionals employable by leading Indian and foreign firms. This programme is designed for those who have an analytical mindset, are interested in tackling challenging business problems, and possess an inclination towards Mathematics. Some of the salient features of the programme include courses taught by reputed faculty members at the campuses of three globally renowned institutes, hands-on business analytics training at a related company, continuous interaction with industry leaders throughout the duration of the programme and the availability of placement opportunities at all the three institutes. The three institutes complement each other to give students the most comprehensive learning of business analytics. The course finds the optimal balance between the theoretical concepts of data science and their applications to business problems. Students get to regularly interact with industry experts through invited talks and guest lectures, where experts talk about the latest trends and challenges in the industry. The course leverages the best of the three institutes in their respective fields of expertise, i.e., Statistics, Technology and Business. In the first semester at ISI, students form a strong base of Mathematical and Statistical concepts. This is followed by a semester at IIT Kharagpur, where students work on data science projects and get to test their statistical concepts built at ISI. This semester is meant to build students’ technical expertise. To complement the first two semesters, students spend their third semester at IIM Calcutta where they are exposed to business problems through case studies and industry interactions. To cap it all, the students get to implement their knowledge in the industry through a six months long internship as their fourth semester. Placements The students from the first two batches of PGDBA experienced highly successful placement processes. Companies from various industries such as BFSI, Consulting, Healthcare, Research, Retail, Gaming, Technology etc. participated and handpicked candidates suitable for both data-driven and business driven analyst roles. The placement processes witnessed the involvement of Fortune 500 companies such as American Express, Walmart Labs, UnitedHealth Group, JPMC, Amazon, Walmart Labs. Some of the job profiles offered were Senior Data Scientist, Analytics Manager, Statistical Analyst, Lead Business Analyst, Solution Analyst, Experienced Associate, Assistant Project Manager. With continuously increasing demand of business analytics professionals, the future of PGDBA looks promising. The unique opportunity of learning from three top-notch institutes of the country is unparalleled by any other Data Analytics course. Recently, PGDBA was ranked 1 by the Analytics India Magazine among the data science courses offered in the country.

It was a crisp Friday morning and I was seated comfortably in the plush IIMC library. The PGDBA semester was well underway, assignments were raining thick and fast…life was busy…life was good and I was brimming with excitement. I had only just begun working on a competition, which had started 4 days ago on June 14th 2016. It was an inter-university data-science competition called the Data Science Game . With so many constraints such as limited number of submissions in a day and final selection of only one team from a college, it was, by all means the “big deal” and a glance at the list of competing universities showed us some tough nuts. There were the usual suspects i.e. Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford et al., supplemented by a host of premier universities from across the world. Certainly our team of four from first-ever batch of PGDBA, though no novices, were far from being among the best in the world… or were they? And so we – Team Tabs – prepared a starting output, clicked on the ‘Make Submission’ button and waited with a muted yet expectation-laced anxiety that any Kaggler worth his salt would be familiar with and then this image popped up on our screen: Most authors describe moments like these with the cliche ‘There was a moment of silence followed by….’ I discovered that they were quite wrong…as my uncontrollable Hagrid-like laughter filled the breadth of the IIM Calcutta library, defiant of the several bemused yet stern glares that were pointed in my direction! Second in the whole world! Irrespective of its ephemerality, irrespective of the pains required to maintain it or the challenges that we were about to face in the coming three weeks – it was a moment of reckoning for us, a moment to cherish, a moment to savour. Yet, when I look back I can say with certainty that it was at this point I started believing that international glory wasn’t beyond our reach. What followed were some of the most gruelling days of my life. Over the next three weeks, we went on to learn and implement Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithms for image classification. We travelled to multiple universities in a quest for servers to run these algorithms. We learnt, we toiled, we toiled hard and we thrived. When the competition ended, we were the top team from India – Yes! Our hard work and perseverance led to us being the Rank 1 Indian team . We were among the 20 teams from around the world selected to travel to Paris for the final phase of the competition and folks, as you read this article, we’re on the flight journey towards the finals of the competition in Paris, to be held on 9th September. What fills me with even more delight is that not just us, but three teams from India have made it to the final 20 – one each from IIM Calcutta-Team Tabs, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata- The Frequentists (in their ranking order). India has made its presence felt in this 2nd edition of Data Science Game and interestingly enough, all the three institutes are what together constitute PGDBA! It is encouraging to see that three Indian teams have proved themselves worthy of being the global top 20 when 146 teams from 28 countries participated and showed their mettle in this grueling competition. The competition contained an image classification problem. A set of images were given, which had to be classified into four categories. The problem at hand could have been done in various ways. We decided to use deep learning as a lot of interesting work is being done around it and it’s one of the most advanced techniques currently available. We had a basic knowledge about it and developed more understanding as we moved along. The process of compiling and executing codes went on and we worked hard every single day. The machine learning algorithms take time to execute and with limited computing power at our disposal and time constraint of the competition, we ensured that every iota of it was used. As we were fighting neck to neck with all top notch universities across the world, the task was not at all easy and there were a lot of hurdles on the way. The limited computing power slowed us down. Every iteration of the code required a whole day and thus constrained our capacity to experiment with the algorithm. Soon other teams caught up with us on the leaderboard. To wrinkle out the problems we went to IIT-KGP and ISI to gain server access. However, the terminals at both places were preoccupied. As a last resort, we decided to use Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was difficult to set-up because of the complex technicalities and as none of us was acquainted with the process, it made our job all the more difficult. We quickly took charge and read about it from the scratch, spending a precious time of 3 days to figure everything out and get it running. In hindsight, it was worth the effort. Our first run in AWS increased the accuracy by 5 % and it all paid off with the jump on the leaderboard. Now that we look at it, a lot of edge was given to us by our PGDBA curriculum. The basics of machine learning and computing were well laid out throughout the course. It enabled us to deep dive into deep learning and comprehend the technical aspects around it. We also consulted with professors for guidance. With Team Tabs standing at 12 in global rankings, we realize that we have learnt a lot on the way, when we were actually working on the problem statement. We will now be competing with some of the top Kagglers in the finals. The finale would certainly provide us with global exposure as we will get a macroscopic view of what’s happening around the world in the field of data science by interacting with top-notch data analysts spread across the world. Since it’s a 2-day competition, the dynamics of the game is bound to change. We haven’t been able to put in continuous concentrated efforts towards the final round owing to the rigorous academic curriculum this semester and us coping up on classes. We do have a lot to cover but we will keep learning new stuff as we have been doing in the past year. Thus a great opportunity for knowledge transfer and networking lies ahead. With everyone’s hopes in us, we make our journey to Paris, where the final leg of the competition awaits… along with our fateful turnout in the 2nd Data Science Game competition.
