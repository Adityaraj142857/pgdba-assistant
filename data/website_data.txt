“Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.”  – Geoffrey Moore, Organizational Theorist & Author
Analytics: Need of the Hour
The amount of data in our world is exploding. As per a McKinsey report, big data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function the  same way as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition. The increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media and the Internet of Things will fuel exponential growth in data in the foreseeable future.
The rapid pace with which data is being generated across  various domains and fields would require people with deep analytical skills to provide insights, enabling companies to gain a competitive edge and offer a better consumer experience. The insights from the data are used for various purposes such as segmentation of customers for better targeting, prediction of churn rate, product recommendation, analysis of customer opinion from media posts, preventive maintenance, management of portfolio risk etc.
Untapped potential in India
In India, the analytics market is expected to double between 2013 and 2018, reaching a figure of US$ 2.3 billion by 2018, according to a report published by NASSCOM and Blueocean Market Intelligence. This will result in a shortage of about 200,000 data scientists in India over the next few years, according to sources in the Analytics Special Interest Group setup by NASSCOM. Hence, creation of trained industry-ready business analytics professionals is the need of the day.
Globally, the demand of data scientists is projected to exceed supply by more than 50% by 2018. To address the paucity of trained workforce in analytics domain, the onus is on the educational institutes to address the needs of the industry.
The three institutes IIM Calcutta, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata are aware of the demand for the well rounded analytics professionals. In order to understand the needs of the industry, a day long conclave was held in January 2015 in IIM Calcutta. Representatives of the leading companies such as KPMG, EXL, Deloitte, LatentView, TCS, Reliance Communication, Deutsche Bank, E&Y, SBI, IBM, Google, Microsoft, HSBC and Cognizant took part in the conclave and based on their inputs, ideas of a specialized course emerged, a course which would produce leaders of the future, skilled in the essential areas of business, statistics and computer science. Through this collaboration between industry and academia, PGDBA was born.
Introduction to PGDBA
PGDBA is a two year full time residential diploma programme aimed at creating business analytics professionals employable by leading Indian and foreign firms. This programme is designed for those who have an analytical mindset, are interested in tackling challenging business problems, and possess an inclination towards Mathematics. Some of the salient features of the programme include courses taught by reputed faculty members at the campuses of three globally renowned institutes, hands-on business analytics training at a related company, continuous interaction with industry leaders throughout the duration of the programme and the availability of placement opportunities at all the three institutes.
The three institutes complement each other to give students the most comprehensive learning of business analytics. The course finds the optimal balance between the theoretical concepts of data science and their applications to business problems. Students get to regularly interact with industry experts through invited talks and guest lectures, where experts talk about the latest trends and challenges in the industry. The course leverages the best of the three institutes in their respective fields of expertise, i.e., Statistics, Technology and Business.
In the first semester at ISI, students form a strong base of Mathematical and Statistical concepts. This is followed by a semester at IIT Kharagpur, where students work on data science projects and get to test their statistical concepts built at ISI. This  semester is meant to build students’ technical expertise. To complement the first two semesters, students spend their third semester at IIM Calcutta where they are exposed to business problems through case studies and industry interactions. To cap it all, the students get to implement their knowledge in the industry through a six months long internship as their fourth semester.
Placements
The students from the first two batches of PGDBA experienced highly successful placement processes. Companies from various industries such as BFSI, Consulting, Healthcare, Research, Retail, Gaming, Technology etc. participated and handpicked candidates suitable for both data-driven and business driven analyst roles. The placement processes witnessed the involvement of Fortune 500 companies such as American Express, Walmart Labs, UnitedHealth Group, JPMC, Amazon, Walmart Labs. Some of the job profiles offered were Senior Data Scientist, Analytics Manager, Statistical Analyst, Lead Business Analyst, Solution Analyst, Experienced Associate, Assistant Project Manager.
With continuously increasing demand of business analytics professionals, the future of PGDBA looks promising. The unique opportunity of learning from three top-notch institutes of the country is unparalleled by any other Data Analytics course. Recently, PGDBA was  ranked 1  by the Analytics India Magazine among the data science courses offered in the country.

The year 2005 | A regular morning in a middle-class Indian’s life
The middle-aged mom heaved a sigh of relief, having just sent off her kids on the school bus. It’s been a busy morning for her; she had woken up early to cook food for her husband and the two darling-turned-devils of her eyes. She returns upstairs and spends the rest of the morning preparing lunch for her kids who’ll soon be home, arguing with her maid, and reminding the security guard for the umpteenth time to call a plumber to repair the leaky faucet in her kitchen. She watches a repeat of her favorite TV show on Star Plus for a while before going to the market and buying fresh vegetables and bread for the next day.
The year 2019 | A technology-enabled morning in an aspirational Indian’s life
The father sits down on the sofa in the living room, exhausted after an early morning run. He checks his Fitbit and grins as the tiny screen highlights that his mean speed was 25% higher than last month’s average. After freshening up, he wakes up the kids and walks over to the living room. While pouring milk and cereal into three bowls, he observes that the pack of cereals is almost empty. His kids enter the living room and call out to Alexa to play their customized playlist of morning songs, and she dutifully obliges. He whips out his phone, opens WhatsApp and video calls his better half who’s away on a business meeting. The happy family reunion is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell, which suggests that Amazon will timely deliver the new toy the younger kid had been demanding for the past week. The dad checks the time, gets dressed quickly, and books a cab while tying his shoes. He drops his kids off to school and orders their favorite pack of cereals on Grofers. He calculates that he has just about enough time to finish the Netflix special that he had dozed off while watching last night. The app’s proprietary algorithm that incessantly analyzes his viewing habit dutifully suggests a new range of TV Shows for him to binge-watch later.
The world is generating a diverse range of data like never before. Over the last couple of years, 90% of the total data in the world has been generated. More than 3.7 billion people use the Internet today, and that number is only increasing. Google is processing more than forty thousand searches every second, while 41000 new pictures are being uploaded on Instagram every minute. By the time you’re done reading this paragraph, Uber riders would’ve taken more than forty-five thousand trips!
In this scenario, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast amount of information they are gathering on their current as well as prospective customers. Social Media is analyzing the behavioral patterns of individual users and predicting their affinities with great accuracy. The entire world is moving towards a connected networking platform with the advent of the Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques. Data has become the new oil, and Data Scientists and Analysts are expected to monetize this oil to the greatest extent possible. But this burgeoning sector is experiencing a shortage of an efficient workforce. The lack of data scientists has become a major constraint, and industries are clamoring for individuals who can make sense of the data they are amassing and provide tangible business advantages. There are a widening demand and supply gap in the market, and five years ago, IIM Calcutta, in conjunction with ISI Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, had sought to capitalize on the mismatch.
That’s how PGDBA was conceptualized, in accordance to the industry demands while paying due heed to their suggestions. As the fourth batch prepares to venture beyond the gates of Joka, the last one and a half years of training imparted at these stellar institutions are going to be employed. The industry has steep expectations of this bunch of talented individuals. They’re expected to draw meaningful insights out of data that benefits their businesses. From risk management to healthcare analytics, to behavioral analytics and digital marketing; the needs that PGDBA graduates are expected to cater to are diverse.
As the world keeps amassing higher amounts of data, it’ll become increasingly difficult to make sense out of it. It’ll be akin to finding the precisely manufactured red coloured needle out of multiple piles of slightly deformed red coloured needles; surgical precision is critical to ensure it does not become a bloodbath. That’s where this course comes in, perfectly positioned to meet the business requirements by capitalizing on the technological advancements of the 21st century.

A peek into Team Tabs, one of the three teams representing India at DSG.
It was a crisp Friday morning and I was seated comfortably in the plush IIMC library. The PGDBA semester was well underway, assignments were raining thick and fast…life was busy…life was good and I was brimming with excitement.
I had only just begun working on a competition, which had started 4 days ago on June 14th 2016. It was an inter-university data-science competition called the  Data Science Game . With so many constraints such as limited number of submissions in a day and final selection of only one team from a college, it was, by all means the “big deal” and a glance at the list of competing universities showed us some tough nuts. There were the usual suspects i.e. Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford et al., supplemented by a host of premier universities from across the world.
Certainly our team of four from first-ever batch of PGDBA, though no novices, were far from being among the best in the world… or were they?
And so we –  Team Tabs  – prepared a starting output, clicked on the ‘Make Submission’ button and waited with a muted yet expectation-laced anxiety that any Kaggler worth his salt would be familiar with and then this image popped up on our screen:
Most authors describe moments like these with the cliche ‘There was a moment of silence followed by….’ I discovered that they were quite wrong…as my uncontrollable Hagrid-like laughter filled the breadth of the IIM Calcutta library, defiant of the several bemused yet stern glares that were pointed in my direction! Second in the whole world! Irrespective of its ephemerality, irrespective of the pains required to maintain it or the challenges that we were about to face in the coming three weeks – it was a moment of reckoning for us, a moment to cherish, a moment to savour. Yet, when I look back I can say with certainty that it was at this point I started believing that international glory wasn’t beyond our reach.
What followed were some of the most gruelling days of my life. Over the next three weeks, we went on to learn and implement Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithms for image classification. We travelled to multiple universities in a quest for servers to run these algorithms. We learnt, we toiled, we toiled hard and we thrived. When the competition ended, we were the top team from India – Yes! Our hard work and perseverance led to us being the  Rank 1 Indian team . We were among the 20 teams from around the world selected to travel to Paris for the final phase of the competition and folks, as you read this article, we’re on the flight journey towards the finals of the competition in Paris, to be held on 9th September.
What fills me with even more delight is that not just us, but three teams from India have made it to the final 20 – one each from IIM Calcutta-Team Tabs, IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata-  The Frequentists  (in their ranking order). India has made its presence felt in this 2nd edition of Data Science Game and interestingly enough, all the three institutes are what together constitute PGDBA! It is encouraging to see that three Indian teams have proved themselves worthy of being the global top 20 when 146 teams from 28 countries participated and showed their mettle in this grueling competition.
The competition contained an image classification problem. A set of images were given, which had to be classified into four categories. The problem at hand could have been done in various ways. We decided to use deep learning as a lot of interesting work is being done around it and it’s one of the most advanced techniques currently available. We had a basic knowledge about it and developed more understanding as we moved along. The process of compiling and executing codes went on and we worked hard every single day. The machine learning algorithms take time to execute and with limited computing power at our disposal and time constraint of the competition, we ensured that every iota of it was used. As we were fighting neck to neck with all top notch universities across the world, the task was not at all easy and there were a lot of hurdles on the way. The limited computing power slowed us down. Every iteration of the code required a whole day and thus constrained our capacity to experiment with the algorithm. Soon other teams caught up with us on the leaderboard. To wrinkle out the problems we went to IIT-KGP and ISI to gain server access. However, the terminals at both places were preoccupied. As a last resort, we decided to use Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was difficult to set-up because of the complex technicalities and as none of us was acquainted with the process, it made our job all the more difficult. We quickly took charge and read about it from the scratch, spending a precious time of 3 days to figure everything out and get it running. In hindsight, it was worth the effort. Our first run in AWS increased the accuracy by 5 % and it all paid off with the jump on the leaderboard.
Now that we look at it, a lot of edge was given to us by our PGDBA curriculum. The basics of machine learning and computing were well laid out throughout the course. It enabled us to deep dive into deep learning and comprehend the technical aspects around it. We also consulted with professors for guidance. With Team Tabs standing at 12 in global rankings, we realize that we have learnt a lot on the way, when we were actually working on the problem statement.
We will now be competing with some of the top Kagglers in the finals. The finale would certainly provide us with global exposure as we will get a macroscopic view of what’s happening around the world in the field of data science by interacting with top-notch data analysts spread across the world. Since it’s a 2-day competition, the dynamics of the game is bound to change. We haven’t been able to put in continuous concentrated efforts towards the final round owing to the rigorous academic curriculum this semester and us coping up on classes. We do have a lot to cover but we will keep learning new stuff as we have been doing in the past year. Thus a great opportunity for knowledge transfer and networking lies ahead. With everyone’s hopes in us, we make our journey to Paris, where the final leg of the competition awaits… along with our fateful turnout in the 2nd Data Science Game competition.

As the founding batch prepares for their final placements, we bring to you a sneak peek into the persona of a unique group of people who are going to cross the borders for their 6-month long internships.
Madhur Modi
It was June 2015 when a set of 51 students set foot on the doorsteps of IIM Calcutta, ready to embark upon a journey filled with chaos! They had no idea how their decision to join this new course – Postgraduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), hosted by the three prestigious institutes in India and the oldest ones in this field would shape their future career. Even though they were all convinced of the strength of data and how it could be used to disrupt entire markets, they themselves weren’t sure what a roller coaster ride they were going to go through. Then, as the time to start the internship semester draws near, 6 students were offered foreign internship offers and today, four of them are traveling to various countries to start their foreign interns. In this founding batch, these six students also contain a blend of people with work experience and freshers and come from diverse backgrounds. Here’s a showcase of their profiles:
Alok Mani Singh  The civil engineer from BHEL, and the “stud” with 4-year worth of experience from a Maharatna PSU and IIT Guwahati attached in his name was the first person who secured his foreign intern in the prestigious Dunia Finance in Dubai. The “Perfect Statistician” as well as the “Management expert” who can solve any problem that comes his way “within a night or two”. He also likes to play guitar and has entertained us for past one and a half years with his pleasant voice. Now he will be working closely with the head of strategic analytics function at Dunia during his 6-month internship in Dubai.
Siddhant Sanjeev  “Coder” as everyone in the batch knows him to be, was the only other person to impress the company Dunia and accompany Alok to Dubai. Everyone in the batch knows him as a fresher with computer science background from NSIT and a national level coder. He also got himself an interview offer from Google owing to his coding skills as well as won case competitions from PwC and Deloitte. He also developed an e-commerce website using intricate concepts of natural language processing, recommendation systems and information retrieval.
Ankitkumar Sonthalia  Better known as “Sonthu”, this guy has 3 years of work experience from Cognizant and now he is going to work for Rocket Internet in Myanmar. He has worked on marketing strategy, predictions and recommendation systems. He is a travel enthusiast and has organized many unforgettable trips for our batch. He has also conducted cricket fantasy league and freshers’ party.
Rachit Tripathi  A mechanical engineer from IIT Kanpur by mind and a quant trader by heart, Rachit bagged an internship in France at QuantCube Technology, a niche fintech company. He’s also part of the team selected for data science game, an international inter-university competition held in Paris. In his pursuit of becoming a quant trader, he obtained CFA level 1 certification and solved various cases from those on Walmart to those on Yahoo data. He is also known as the “data scientist” of the batch and has recently been selected as one of the finalists in Goldman Sachs Quantify competition.
Avinash Kumar  He is a mechanical engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has worked in L&T for 3 years. He was offered an internship at Rocket Internet which he did not take as he aspired to work in India. He has written an international research paper and also has been part of the Data Science Game with Rachit during this course. He also won NASA systems engineering award while being a B.Tech. student. Besides, he is also a skilled TT player as well as a chess enthusiast.
Bharathi Ramaraj  Bharathi got the internship offer from Rocket Internet but she decided to stay in India. The only girl to get a foreign internship offer, she is a fresher with B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering. She has worked on uplift modeling, high-frequency data and news analytics and has taken part in various Kaggle competitions. She is also an international chess player and has traveled to as many as 16 countries representing India. She envisions being a financial analyst and to use advanced analytics techniques in a financial credit company to build her career.
Despite such varying backgrounds and profiles, students of PGDBA were able to spread the word about the program and attained internships in various places like Dubai, France and Myanmar. A lot of us were not sure about what we will be able to achieve when we started this journey, but now seeing the accomplishments, as showcased by the examples above, we have grown a lot more confident in our abilities and can envisage a clearer picture of our future in the analytics world.
Best wishes to the entire batch for their internship semester! We are sure that all of you will imprint the brand PGDBA in the world of data analytics.

A Semester in Class with Souravda

“December is a wonderful time to be in Calcutta”, remarked the Director of ISI Kolkata, Prof. Sanghamitra Bandopadhyay, as she addressed the participants of a workshop on Machine Learning yesterday. In winter, Calcutta and the ISI campus seem to be embedded in a timescale of their own. The cool climate, with the leisure of end of semester break and the occasional  chai  in little earthen cups are an apt climax to a wonderful first leg of the PGDBA course here at ISI.
We had the opportunity to attend a lecture delivered by Dr. Sourav Sengupta held in the same Machine Learning workshop this week. Souravda, as he insisted we must call him when we first met in July, taught us a course titled ‘Computing for Data Science’ in this semester’s coursework. The topic of his workshop lecture on Tuesday was Linear Algebra and I couldn’t help but smile as I reminisced the most enjoyable classroom experience that I had in the past semester. When I decided on writing this piece I was lost for ideas on how to do justice, in the measure of just a few words, to a semester’s worth of constantly brilliant teaching. Just plain superlatives for Dr. Sourav Sengupta would not suffice to explain the privilege I feel in being his student.
There are many moments in class that I felt amazed as he walked us through a topic, drawing out concept after concept, most times exercising the last resource of our grey cells. With his characteristic smiles and pauses, he conducted the class like an orchestra maestro. He was always thoroughly prepared with the flow of his lectures that were packed with information and insight. Maybe trying to recap a few highlights would help reflect the memorable journey we’ve had in class.
Of our first few trysts in Souravda’s class was the one with Linear Algebra. He introduced matrix multiplication as an operation on vector spaces. Starting with linear combinations of vectors and the space they spanned, he guided us to a vector space representation of the linear least squares estimate of a system of equations. This might seem arcane to some, but the charm was in the ease with which he explained the ideas of multidimensional spaces and vectors in the context of something as simple as least squares approximation. Another of such crescendos was when he tied eigen values, Markov chains and the power method in a lecture on how Google first developed a base for ranking webpages called PageRank. It was almost a revelation when I first realised, “So this is a Markov chain!”
In another lecture, Souravda explained the notion of volume as it applies to higher dimensions. He compared a unit ball with a unit square. A unit square in two dimensions is completely contained inside a unit ball. The farthest that a square can get from the origin is root of  1/2 (1/4 +1/4 = 2/4)  whereas a unit circle is at a fixed distance of  1 . In three dimensions, a cuboid is still inside a sphere and the farthest it gets to is square root of  3/4 . Now, as we move up to four dimensions, the farthest point inside the ‘box’ is at square root of  4/4  which is  1 . So in four dimensions, the box just touches the ball but is still contained entirely inside it. “What happens, when we move higher up”, asked Souravda in class. It so happens that the unit box creeps out of the ball in the fifth dimension and further up, in still higher dimensions, most of the volume of the box is not contained inside the ball. This was just one aspect of the notion of distances that he discussed. In another class, we discussed the distance between two sentences or text corpuses to see how similar or different they were. And as measures of similarity of two sets, Souravda then introduced us to hash functions and MinHashing.
“How would you develop a system to choose one person from three people, uniformly at random, by using just the outcomes of coin tosses?” This is one of Prof. Bimal Roy’s favourite questions (previous Director and professor of MathStat department) that Souravda introduced in class with us. He then extended the discussion to choosing uniformly at random from  n  people and then on to storing streaming data in an efficient way.
PCA, SVD, Linear Regression and Regularisation, Clustering, Classification and Regression Trees, Bias-Variance Trade-off in learning algorithms, SVM, Recommender Systems, Expectation Maximisation are the other broad topics that he discussed at a constant level of commitment and brilliance.
And that is just his teaching. There’s another side to the person that is Souravda. His utmost sincerity and dedication, at times when it seemed unimaginable why a person should go so far out of his way to help, was an immeasurable gift during the course.
At times when he explained algorithms for certain applications, he would use the common refrain, “But can you do any better?” in trying to guide us to more efficient solutions. A lesson that Souravda’s students could take from his classes, of which his own dedication was sufficient evidence, was to keep asking themselves, “Can you do any better?”
Thank you and farewell, Dr. Sourav Sengupta.

PGDBA chronicles: The First semester!

Here comes our atta boy, our cheerful Madhur Modi to speak about our first semester at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. He is a CS grad, tinted with the experience of working in Acrobat Team, Adobe, India for 11 months. Let’s hear what Madhur says!
After a not-so long orientation and pre-semester at IIM C, it was time to move to ISI. All of us were already feeling the attachment we had built with each other and formed the spirit of ‘joka tribe’ within ourselves. We started our journey to learn and started packing… but we were not done with the pre-semester yet! 🙂
Not before we can have a last photo-session! Even the journey to ISI was an insightful one! Filled with discussions of memories made within the short month.
Happy faces!
I remember us all at the peak of our enthusiasm when we visited ISI for the first time after the orientation, this time for around 6 months with knowledge imparted from renowned teachers. Since each of us had opted for the hostel facilities, the registration day was spent in lodging and document formalities. It all began with 5 subjects, 8 teachers and 51 students – daily two hour classes, twice daily where a moment of flickering attention meant you’ll lose the ability to grasp anything for the rest of the class. Yes! We had teachers who could teach us their subject continuously for two hours and every moment… each of them they made us wonder how amazing it is to learn in an enjoyable fashion. We all felt so comfortable moving from our 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional minds to nth dimensions and then move down using multidimensional scaling ☺ ☺ (was I too technical here? Come to ISI and you’ll know what I mean). I bet all our teachers from ISI would be laughing reading the joke here.
By the ways, if you’re writing about ISI, it won’t be a just article if you do not mention each teacher separately! Starting from our class teacher and DBMS teacher prof. Pinakpani Pal, it was him who would come to our rescue each time, whether it is to change the mess, requirement of any additional facilities, aid in any procedures or help regarding the subject. He would kindly reach out his hand and solve all our problems in a flick. DBMS was also taught by prof. Amiya and prof. Dilip who would take care of SQL teaching for us. Thanks to him, DBMS was one of the most comfortable subjects in ISI.
I still remember the fact that 44 teachers have bhattacharya awards in their name! We all used to marvel at the level of knowledge at ISI, rather, we felt grateful to our teachers for feeding such golden nuggets of information to us daily and Prof. Debasis is the teacher who’s teaching reminded us the reasons they won those awards. I always felt that he teaches one subject but I learned things anyone would consider is worth much more! From histograms, scatter plots, distributions and tests for distributions, he took us to bivariate and the multivariate analysis followed by more tests and feature selection. Moreover, he took extra classes and doubt sessions every week just to ensure that when we learn, we learn well
When you start talking about the teachers, each teacher is better than the other! We had Statistical Probabilistic Analysis taught by two teachers, Prof. Bimal and Prof. Kishan. It was the only subject with no assignments, since probability has such a wide scope. This class was all practical, we were given real life examples and applied concepts to solve them. There was yet another similar subject, inference, taught by Prof. Amitava which encompassed all other subjects and drew inference tests from each of them, filled with more real life examples.
We had one more course, or rather, set of course ☺ Computing in data science taught by Prof. Saurav Sengupta. I could proudly say to those non-cse students who fear how they would learn programming techniques- this is the course that will help you make your first transition. From practically negligible knowledge, this course taught us not just R and Python, but also made us do an entire team project to deep seat the lessons in our hearts. The best thing? We had fun! I would frequently visit the  course website  and our  project blog  and proudly say that we have come far, far from where we were when we entered ISI. P.S. do check out the blog of group 1 authored by our group. 🙂
Didn’t I mention anything else besides studies? How forgetful of me! ISI is a place of happenings! Every other day there were announcements of workshops in various fields of statistics and there were a variety of activities which would now be sweet memories for us with ISI. We flew kites, we had birthday parties, we played games and we had our first formal photoshoot!
Looking smart!
ISI also had a very special memory… Diwali! What’s that? How did we celebrate it? I could boast that it was better than any student had celebrated while at college! Two of our batchmates, Mr. Avinash (a.k.a. Gandhi) and Mukul cleaned their room and turned it into the  Pooja venue (see photos in link) We made diyas, did Pooja, sang bhakti songs, distributed Prasad and  made rangoli ! We burnt a  few  crackers and all our  rooms illuminated  with the auspiciousness on that day! It was one of the best Diwali celebrations of my life!
Diwali!
Soon after Durga puja, Diwali and Kali puja, we had our final exams and had to say “Bye Bye ISI” I am thankful that our first semester was conducted at ISI where we learnt such a great deal and progressed so far ahead in our skills. It already feels like we can do most of business analytics even though we have ways to go.
How could be go away without saying a delightful adios to our Indian Statistical institute? We requested all the teachers to come for a final photoshoot session. Besides one photo present in  CDS website , another photo from the last day would mark a fitting ending to our memories and knowledge lending roller coaster ride at the pillar of statistical, mathematical and machine learning institute!
Adios! Indian Statistical Institute

Nice to read your experience at ISI. I have one query : I have got 91.85 in Cat 2015 held in November 2015. I am eligible to apply? Thanks in advance
There would be a separate application and test process for this year. Your Cat 2015 percentile won’t matter in this regard. I hope you have applied!
I have applied for the test. Could you please tell me what to expect in interview from your experience as i have around 2 months to prepare for it.
At this point, do focus on the written test first. You should again be prepared with mathematics for the interview as well. Most of the other questions besides maths are similar to a typical IIM interview. You will need to prepare additional topics as well such as probability and differentiation. Based on your profile, some specific questions might be asked. Also, stay tuned for future posts on the blog where we may post further insights!
Thankyou Sir 😀

– Himanshu Goyal
The first step is the hardest.  – Unknown
When one first hears about the PGDBA course, the aspect which captures one’s attention the most is that it is studied at three different institutes. It seems a bit confusing at the start but soon one gets fascinated by it. The fact that each aspect of business analytics is taught by a specialized institute seems like a perfect horses-for-courses strategy.
When I first heard about it, there was one name out of the three which captured my imagination the most and made me take this course seriously. That was ISI Kolkata – the pinnacle for statisticians. It is not to say that IIT Kharagpur and IIM Calcutta are insignificant names – popularity-wise that would be opposite – but the fact that an institute which is known more for its research-oriented approach, and not for focussing on fat pay checks, was a part of this curriculum made me think that I might actually learn something in this course and not just bide my time until the placement season. Hence I can say that ISI is one of the primary reasons for me being in this course. Now that the ISI phase is over I feel it imperative to share my experience. Due to space constraints, I will limit this article to my academic experience and not the  student life  there.
We studied 5 courses there and though I will not be able to do justice to each of them in this short space, I will try my best to give an overview of what we studied in each course.
1.   Stochastic Processes and its Applications :
Randomness is the true foundation of mathematics.  – Gregory Chaitin
This course can be thought of as 3-in-1. It started with probability problems (check out gambler’s ruin problem if gambling is your thing), their ingenious solutions and then expanded to probability distributions. In almost no time at all, we shifted gears from simple coin tosses to complex problems involving combinations of probability and calculus. When we got done with it all in one month, we found out that it was a precursor to stochastic processes. We then spent a good amount of time studying Markov chains which has innumerable practical applications in today’s world (Google’s PageRank algorithm). If that was not enough in one semester, we also got an introduction to time series forecasting in final stages of the course.
Probability, Stochastic Processes and Time Series forecasting – All three have the potential to be a separate course in themselves for one whole semester. While we couldn’t cover each one of them extensively, the course was a good starting point for someone looking for further studies in this area. It also covered enough of the three sub-topics so that we wouldn’t be sitting ducks when facing practical problems in this subject.
2.  Statistical Structures in Data :
Statistics is the grammar of science.  – Karl Pearson
Arguably the most important course of the semester. This course dwelled into pure statistics which started from simple properties of a distribution such as mean, median, variance, etc. We then moved to solve regression problems which started from univariate and culminated in multivariate statistics. This course also introduced us to various concepts in machine learning such as PCA, Factor Analysis, GLM and Decision Trees. Don’t worry if all these terms look Chinese to you, many of us weren’t aware of it either before stepping into ISI.
Going by the internship interview experience of the first batch of PGDBA, it was considered to be the most important course. I believe that is because being a data analyst is not about being able to run a code in a software, rather it is about understanding the concepts behind the scenes and use that to extract maximum information. This course does exactly that.
3.  Inferences:
It is a hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow; and this means that we do not know whether it will rise.  – Ludwig Wittgenstein
English is never going to be the same for you once you attend this course. This course gave a glimpse into how technical can one get into statistics. We found that many things which would seem a mere nuisance to a ‘normal’ person actually have a lot of difference when it comes to statistics. Likelihood and Probability take on a new meaning altogether; Parameter, Statistic, Estimator and Estimate will always seem like a case of so-near-yet-so-far. We also covered the concept of hypothesis testing and its applications. Any statistics-101 book will have these topics and this particular course coupled with the one above forms the crux for which one comes to ISI.
It is quite easy to commit mistakes in statistics by missing out on one or two seemingly trivial assumptions. This course taught us to be really careful with what we state and what we assume. At the same time, it taught us concepts which have direct applications in the real world and in the realm of statistics.
4.  Computing for Data Sciences (CDS) :
Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid; humans are slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are powerful beyond imagination.  – Leo Cherne (This quote is often wrongly attributed to Einstein)
One of my batch-mates has already written a whole  article  dedicated to this course and its faculty. And the reason for that is simple – We learnt the most in this course. This course takes you on a journey of data science where you become fascinated by it. Each one of our classes was focussed on one topic and the number of  topics  we ended up covering in the entire semester was humongous. If coverage of so much theory wasn’t enough, we also had hands-on sessions in class on R. This was also the only course in ISI in which we did a complete data science project from scratch. You can find the list of projects done by 2016 batch  here  (and  here  for 2015 batch).
We have spent one month at IIT KGP and we are already seeing the benefits of what we covered in CDS. Having got a glimpse into the multitude of topics earlier, it is now much easier for us to get into the flow of each topic which are being taught in separate courses.
5.  Fundamentals of Database Systems :
Unless structure follows strategy, inefficiency results.  – Alfred D. Chandler
This was probably the least thought-out course of the five in this semester. And that worked both ways for us. We finished the stipulated curriculum halfway through the semester and hence the faculty left it unto us what we wanted to cover. Students suggested the topics and were duly obliged. The first half of semester got us acquainted with MySQL. We then studied normalization of databases in detail which talked about how an efficient and accurate database can be designed. We also studied Information Retrieval, MapReduce and Market-basket model in the latter half of semester.
In total, we spent exactly 4 months at ISI. That is by no means sufficient amount of time to get the maximum potential out of that place but you make peace with what you get. The learning at ISI was unique at the very least and it provided the perfect kick start we needed in this course. We covered a breadth of topics in a couple of courses and went into depth as well wherever necessary. These courses have laid a solid foundation and now we are in a position to apply these concepts and see if we can really make the data speak. The first and the hardest step has been taken. Now is the time to cover the distance.

Madhur Modi  takes up the onus of compiling interview experiences of students currently enrolled in PGDBA 2015-17 batch. The aim is to provide a general idea about the profile of the students and their respective interview experiences to help aspirants prepare better for the big day.
PS – The interview panel consisted of three members.
Bharathi Ramaraj  – B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering; International Chess Player
“I introduced myself as a chess player. And the first thing that followed was why I wanted to pursue Analytics, being a chess player. I said, I wanted to make an impact, also decision making plays a big role in analytics thus being a chess player gives me the apt mindset in the field. I gave real-life examples where I used chess playing skills and also highlighted my enthusiasm towards chess by describing how I view situations as a chessboard and how I involve members as pieces playing the game. The panelists gave me new situations to test my viewpoint by letting me turn the interview into a game of chess where the panelists and I were pieces on the board. I took up the problem and described various strategies that I had at my disposal. I spoke at length about the best strategy that I would deploy to win the game. They also asked about the factors which led me to pursue analytics like my placement in an analytics company and why I wanted to complete postgraduate studies. To this I replied, doing it now would help me save time and gain an early advantage which will be very valuable in the long run. My interview was relatively short compared to other candidates.”
******
Shashank Kumar  -B.Tech in EEE , 2.5+ years of experience in VLSI design
“I was the first person to be interviewed at my center. The conversation started with current affairs and the morning news. The analytics projects during my engineering were heavily focused upon. Technical questions included topics like probability, regression, various types of regression and analysis of the quality of fit based on residual plots. The interview spanned around 15 minutes. In hindsight, I think it was a pretty short interview”
******
Sajal Jain  – Class representative (PGDBA 2015-2017),B.Tech in Civil Engineering with 4 years of experience in software industry
“My interview wasn’t strictly a technical one. The few questions included questions on differentiability and continuity and other basic mathematical concepts. My interview majorly focused on how, in my view, my background of civil engineer with more than 4 years of experience in software industry would indulge in a career in analytics and add a different value and perspectives to the batch. The questions were not at all tough so I would advise the candidates to be firm in their basics”
******
Ayan Sengupta , a fresher who has done BSc and MSc in mathematics and computing
“Having a background different from most of the other candidates, my interview was naturally quite unique in its own way. I expected a tough line of questioning from the panelists but my interview consisted of aptitude questions such as how I would find a method for the CEO of the company I work in to cross a river given that he doesn’t know swimming. There were also other puzzles such as –  Why manholes are round and simple mathematical questions covering number theory . The interview was around 20-25 minutes long.”
******
Shoorvir Gupta , a fresher in mechanical engineering and an IES aspirant
“My interview started with the description of my college and grades. I mentioned my college life and how I became inclined towards gaming, had all A’s in technical subjects, very high CAT score and a 10 pointer in internship. The rest of the interview was focused on IES and related questions to various fields in IES, questions on strength of material and on boilers and its parts (mechanical subjects). Technical questions were mostly around probability and statistics and its applications. Towards the end of the interview they also asked about my background and hometown related questions.”
******
Ritwik Prashant , a fresher with B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and amongst the most meticulous students within the batch
“I started with my introduction and how I was in touch with analytics (Coursera courses). I also described my interests in fantasy football where one has to apply optimizations and statistics in decision making. Technical questions were based around matrices where they made a deep dive until they touched unfamiliar topics. Being a fresher from IIT Madras, they also questioned me about my college placement and my orientation towards this course rather than taking up a job. Thus my entire interview was based on the initial steer I had provided with my introduction.”
******
Pranita Khandelwal , a fresher with dual degree (EEE and Economics)
“The interview started off with the recurring question about my degrees- how I ended up studying both Economics and EEE.  Later, I was tested on my knowledge of econometrics, and the panel asked some conceptual questions on linear regression and decision making using hypothesis testing. This was followed by questions related to my projects and internships .”
******
Avinash Kumar,  a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience
“I steered my interview with my introduction towards my college project at USA and my job profile description. The questions covered as to how I could apply data analytics to these projects and how other projects such as six sigma projects are related to analytics. Among technical questions, most of them were based on geometry and also tested my creativity and open mindedness. I had applied through GATE and was oriented towards aerodynamics so I mentioned why I wanted to pursue an analytics career and implement analytics in aerodynamics sector. I highlighted my orientation with awards (NASA system engineering award-1st prize) and description of college project. Even though most of the other candidates had 15 minute interviews that day, mine was a lengthy 35 minute one.”
******
Mukul Kumar , a mechanical engineer with 2.5 years of manufacturing experience and with same background as Avinash Kumar
“Just like Avinash, I steered my interview with my introduction towards why I wanted to pursue analytics. I mentioned how I had researched and gained opinion about analytics from my peers and seniors and felt that the course aligns with my interests in mathematics and thus I can do justice to the course. Technical questions included mathematical ones (hyperbolic functions and their graphs, differentiation,1st differentiation principle and limit) but none on mechanical engineering.  I had also applied through GATE and was asked  the interview calls I had received. There were also questions based on puzzles and a few questions from written test which we had given during the pre-interview process.”
******
Sujan Biswas  – BSc and MSc in chemistry,  2.75 years of experience in Banking and financial services
“My panelists began with questions about my background and current job profile and drifted over to mathematical questions covering even and odd functions and matrices. Other questions included optimization based questions and decision making problems such as the methods and parameters one would use to determine whether to provide a loan to an individual or not. There were also situational problems such as – Given that Ph.D students have a higher default rate but high profits and MBA students have lower default rate and lower profits, how would you define your business. Overall my interview was nice and the panelists were not grilling.”
******
Mohammed Tariq , B.Tech in computer science in engineering, 10 months of experience in Business intelligence
“Prior to joining the course, I described my experience of a 6-month certification course in analytics. I was also asked about statistics. They asked in-depth questions on calculus going to the levels at which I could not solve. Since I have already done a PG course which used R programming language, Tableau tool and projects, I answered what subjects I learned during the course, experience of the course and my development of interest in PGDBA after completing the course. The interview was mainly focused on my interests in analytics.”

There were questions on probability and Bernoulli process, distributions and questions related to formulae. I was also asked about my job experience which primarily focussed upon customer analytics and acquisition. I had left my job and travelled places which I described vividly along with blogs I wrote during the time. The interview also covered current affairs with my opinion about topics related to net neutrality (which was a trending topic at that time) .”

Another major question was why analytics? I also answered queries about my undergraduate paper which was on neural networks, how they can be applied in the field of mechanical engineering. I gave an overview of the management related subjects during my college such as operations research, optimization and finance. Thus my interview was mainly filled with drilling questions on my job profile, SHM, mechanical engineering and college paper”
******
Manaswi Veligatla,  B.Tech in Instrumentation engineering with 10 months of experience in petrochemical sector
“My interview began around my job description and job profile and part time financial work. This took the interview towards the methods to analyze data.

[I was not expecting a question on an elective that was totally unrelated to my graduation stream, but interviews are unpredictable]  (9) Another prof asked me if I know about need of consultants in Electrical Grid Management? (To this I answered No). So, she asked me to give it a thought as it was related to my profile.

(4) It would be better if you go with a genuine question prepared that you want to ask the interviewer at the last, instead of making a random question there. [After all last impression can add some brownie points].

Prioritize maximizing the written exam score so that you have a cushion and can afford to mess up a bit in the interview and still make it.  You need to have your +2 level math concepts rock-solid to ace the written exam, and as for VARC and DILR, some CAT type mocks might help since not a lot of content specifically geared towards PGDBA is available yet. DILR is generally very scoring so you should try to get all correct.  For interview, be absolutely confident with whatever work you do, and if you’re a fresher, be confident in your undergrad or postgrad course subjects. Try having an idea about how you could incorporate analytics into your work field and why you wanna switch to analytics (if you are switching), and have a concrete understanding of the basics of linear algebra, probability and statistics. And of course, don’t forget the general affairs!

Keep a note of questions you found challenging the first time you solved and keep revisiting them periodically to get comfortable with the Quant section.  2. DILR and VARC are comparatively simpler than CAT, so don’t need to solve very difficult problems while practicing for these sections.  3. For interview, try to frame the introduction in a way that drives the professors to your strong points. Be strong with Probability Statistics, Linear Algebra and first year Engineering Math basics. There will certainly be some questions from one of these topics.

(I said linear algebra, calculus..)  1. Suppose you have A 5X2 and B 2X5. What can you say about the rank of AB. Why?  Tried to explain.. he said I’m just applying a formula.. so i said we can take a variable matrix A, B and multiply them… Then convert it into Row Reduced form, I’m sure we’ll get rank almost  2). P3 was specifically called on to ask “Engineering Questions”.  P3: Is relaminarisation possible? ( I said its been a long time, I don’t remember. He said these are basics, you should not forget) What’s choking in a flow?  How does it impact the diameter of the nozzle?  What if I keep increasing the diameter? (I said as the diameter increases, pressure decreases and if the flow is too fast, there will be shocks)  What’s an instantaneous flow? (No time lag between starting and the point in consideration)  How do you measure an instantaneous flow?  ( I was trying to explain some method, he said it’s differential calculus)  What is Euler’s integral theorem? (complex analysis.. explained from what I remembered. Forgot to use the word residue.)  What’s the difference between Hessian and Jacobian?  (Explained that Hessian is used to get an idea about the maxima and minima while Jacobian is used while transforming coordinate axis)  Where do you use them?  If I say one of them contains first order partial derivatives of vector valued function what will it be?  (I said Jacobian. He asked if I’m sure, then I said both contains first order partial derivatives. Then he said one of them has partial derivatives of scalar valued function and one has partial derivatives of vector valued function)  In simulations, we use Euler’s method 1, Kutta 2, Kutta 4.. what’s the difference?  (I said these are used for numerical integration.. he said *that’s not it*.. they have something to do with the time factor.)  After that, he said to other profs, we have asked him enough questions.. they agreed and they said I may leave.

PGDBA  stands for  Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics  ( PGDBA website ), probably the first two year full time course in India, jointly offered by Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. PGDBA has been started with the philosophy that data is the new oil in this century. With an abundance of data, driving a business successfully and effectively is becoming a tricky aspect. Recent surveys suggest that big data could create $300 billion in value in healthcare alone each year; clever use of location data across industries could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. Conversely, poor data management can cost up to 35% of a business’s operating revenue. While the possibility and ability to capture and store the ocean of data has grown up to overwhelming levels, but the right use of techniques to extract ‘information’ from these data sets has not been keeping pace with the demands of the industry, and there continues to be a worrying skill shortage across all sectors. More specifically saying, crunching data to generate necessary business insights requires a strong hold on Statistics, Technology and Business simultaneously. The requirement is so rare that the industry hardly sees individuals having the amalgamation of all of these three crucial skills in the domain of Business Analytics.
To cater to this need, PGDBA has been built based on three pillars: Math and Statistics, Technology and Business, as clear from the expertise of the parenting institutes. This course offers four semester with an introductory pre-semester. It is true that two years is not adequate enough to generate data scientists and one can hardly scratch the surface of Machine learning and Data mining, but the unique combination of this course gives it a distinct identity which unravels endless opportunities to the participants: Financial analysis, Consultancy, PhD in Machine Learning, R&D, entrepreneurship to build data-driven startups…you name it!

I had to explain them the project. There were questions on Joins in SQL (some random sample data and they asked me to get a result). I remember briefly the question. Q1: There were some tickets along with their timestamp (created time stamp). Against each row, there was a column highlighting if the ticket if closed or not. Also, another columns showcasing the time when the ticket was closed. I had to find the maximum time taken by a ticket to get closed. Same for minimum. Also, how many tickets are still not closed? All using joins.Solution: Just do a left join on the ticket id and Mark the condition as closing date greater then opening date. Then calculate the difference in the time stamps (Closing-Open). Then group by functionality can be used to get the results.The discussion on this went for around 10-15 minutesKnowledge about Left Join and Inner Join was sufficient. They also made me write sub nested sub queries. The level was not very difficult. Maths/Stats questions What is correlation? Draw some examples? Basic idea about regression? They made me draw some graphs of some functions. They were bit tricky, but doable. GK/Current Affairs asked (if any) Yes Is the interview stressful?

How do you relate yourself to analytics? Why is analytics a buzz word these days? Maths/Stats questions I was asked to solved an integral with cubic expression in the denominator. It reduced to a fraction of linear and quadratic expressions upon partial fraction. I forgot the formula for the standard quadratic at that time, so showed the panelist the expression formed. GK/Current Affairs asked (if any) Yes Is the interview stressful? Yes Tips for Written Exam NCERT mathematics is a great source for fundamental mathematics, and that easily got me through 75% of the maths section. The remaining question needed an extensive deductibility of NCERT concepts. Some standard AIEEE (JEE Main) book might be helpful. Do cover calculus portion judiciously and diligently. Tips to fill Application Form We were asked to provide our extensive background, including why you want to join this course, and hobbies. To answer the first question, I related the course to my long term goal and it made the whole process a cakewalk. Hobbies is something that should be genuine and something that you really are passionate about. the panelists can easily sense when a person is cooking up, and then they can grill you down even further. Personal Interview TIME mock interviews were a great help. To supplement the analytics domain knowledge, linear algebra basic concepts, normal distribution fundamentals, engineering level project management or operation optimization topics like decision tree and transportation problems might come in handy.

I said Yes and from that point interview started. Maths/Stats questions Q1. Find probability mass function of discrete random variable at one point giving its value at all other points? Ans:- Sum of probabilities is 1. So subtracted the sum of probabilities of all other points from 1 to get required answer. This took a good amount of time for calculation and gave correct answer. Q2. Plot the probability mass function of above discrete random variable? Ans:- I drawn it correctly. Q3. Find the probability of a continuous discrete random variable to lie between 1 and 2 giving cumulative distribution function (cdf)? Ans:- If cfd=f(x) then integrate f(x)dx with between lower limit 1 and higher limit 2. I did not solve it completely i drawn the graph and shaded area and wrote the integration form. Interviewer seen the equation and said it correct and not needed to solve completely. Q4. Find expected value of expected value of discrete random variable in first question? Ans:- summation of xf(x) from x=-infinity to x=infinity where f(x) is pmf in terms of random variable x. I answered it correctly. Q5. Find the expected value for the continuous random variable in third question? Ans:- Integration of xf(x) from x=-infinity to x=infinity where f(x) is cdf I answered it correctly. Then he asked if i know about situations of two random variables. I said i can do but only to basic level. Interviewer said he will ask basic level questions only and asked. Q6. Joint pdf of two random variable X and Y is given and asked to find marginal cdf of y where 0<x<y<1. Ans:- Integrate the x from 0 to y for the joint pdf to get marginal cdf in term of y. I answered it correctly. Q7. Find the probability of the function now? Ans:- We have to integrate the maginal cdf in y for its limits 0 to 1 where we get answer as 1. I got confused about the lower limit of integration here weather 0 or x. I took a bit of time in thinking and expressed doubt put x but he said it wrong then changed to 0. Sir( interviewer) later gave reason for it. Q8. Draw the plot of the joint pdf region? Ans:- I drawn the region 0<x<y<1 and shaded region on XY axis correctly.

Maths/Stats questions What is the probability that the digits of a randomly selected three-digit number will be in ascending order from left to right (without repetitions)?
Answer: 0 can’t be a part of the number. So, there are 9 numbers to choose from. When you have selected three digits out of 9, there are 6 permutations possible, out of which only in 1 will the digits be in ascending order from left to right.
So, total number of desired 3-digit numbers = 9C3 Total number of 3-digit numbers = 9*10*10
Probability = (9C3)/900

Full name Manasvi G College Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Specialization B. Tech in ECE (Avionics) Work Experience (in Months) Fresher Organization(Name) – Designation – Work Experience Background – Interview Location city Bangalore Rating interview experience (out of 5 being very good) 5 Relevant Technical/ Analytics/ML questions What is MNF transform? Why did I use MNF transform instead of a simple PCA during satellite image processing? Maths/Stats questions Since I was a fresher from the space science industry, the first interviewer asked me as to why I wanted to shift from space to business analytics. I replied saying that my interest has shifted towards business analytics when I took electives like deep learning and optimization for operations research. I also mentioned that at the same time, my ‘interest’ and ‘grades’ in electronics subjects were gradually going down. They asked me to model an equation consisting of these two variables, and they also asked me to first answer as to which variable was independent and which was the dependent variable. Initially it took me some time to understand the question during that period I explained as to how these parameters depended on various other factors. Later when I understood their point of view, I answered that interest is an independent variable and grades are a dependent variable as the grades depend on my preparation, my attentiveness in class, etc. The first panelist seemed to be very happy with my response and handed over the baton to the second panelist, who asked me questions about my internship which was based on satellite data analysis. GK/Current Affairs asked (if any) The third panelist asked me questions related to my hobby and was upset to see that I had written just three sentences for the given three blanks. He mentioned that everyone has written very short replies to hobbies. I described all the sentences in detail and they asked me about the different kinds of books I read, followed by questions about my other hobby which was teaching the lesser privileged kids. They asked me questions as to what I taught and which grade of students I taught. That shifted to languages when I mentioned that I sometimes teach in the native mother tongue so as to drive my point home and make the students understand more clearly. My next question was what are the official languages of Andhra Pradesh and then I was asked about languages of Kashmir. I took a wild guess, and also told them it was a guess. Everybody just laughed and a few guesses turned to be right while a few of them were wrong. Is the interview stressful? No Tips for Written Exam Math is the most important section. I think 11th and 12th NCERT math would be the best place to start and brush up basics and later go on to practicing advanced math problems. Data interpretation and logical reasoning are pretty straight forward, and easy to solve. Going through last year question papers would be highly beneficial as a certain trend can be observed in the question paper pattern and one can prepare accordingly. Tips to fill Application Form This is very important, especially for freshers because all the questions in the interview are going to revolve around whatever has been written in the application form. Do not forget to mention any relevant projects since they will add an edge to your profile and the interviewers can ask questions related to those projects as freshers will not have any work experience. Also fill in the hobbies section carefully and thoroughly. Personal Interview I went through the interviews of previous years and made a list of topics to study and go through. But at the end of the day, I’ve been asked questions only based on whatever I have filled in the interview application form. I think its best to be authentic and candid throughout the interview process. Also, one should have a certain clarity as to why they want to pursue this course and how it would be beneficial to them in their future. The panelists are looking for candidates who have a keen interest and passion for business analytics. If they get a feeling that you are genuinely interested and have done your homework in this field, then the chances of converting the interview is very high. Any other interaction post-interview Why business analytics and why not space industry? This has been asked by two panelists. They were probably just surprised, the second panelist realized that I already answered and then he just said congratulations and all the best.

Shubhodeep Dey – B.Tech, Chemical Engineering, NITK, Surathkal, 2013; 33 months of experience in Petrochemicals, Reliance Industries Limited
Duration: 20 mins
I had done a lot of projects during my job so they started with what is the most innovative thing you have done. As soon as I started with my answer, they started asking me random questions on the assembly line (petrochemical industries don’t have anything related to assembly lines). I was able to answer some of them. Then they drew a curve on the sheet and asked me what is the covariance between the data points. I had a good idea about this concept so I could deliver. They moved on to probability and wanted me to visualise a binomial distribution for the number of defectives being produced by a lathe machine given a probability of finding a defective. I could satisfy them by writing down the equations. Some more probability questions followed on coin tosses. My interview ended with a concluding question – what are the major oil producing economies which are not a part of OPEC?
All in all, it went fairly good, I got stuck on few of their questions but they were kind enough to guide me. You don’t have to know everything, what they are looking for is the approach to the problem. Confidence and clarity of thoughts are key factors. The written exam had a heavy contribution in the final selection.

2 basic mathematics questions-Based on definite Integrals of some box function, Integration of some trigonometric function
SUGGESTIONS-I think admission committee looked for a balanced profile. It was also written on the website that they will look for Academic, test score and interview performance. As my academic performance was very good, despite “only-good” performance in test and interview, overall weight got balanced.

Tell me about yourself. Do you have other interview calls?
A puzzle was given to solve – there are 3 bottles and a coin, so the probability of choosing a bottle is 1/3 but you have to get this probability by flipping a coin. What is the method to achieve the desired result?
Answer: flip the coin twice and assign each bottle a unique id i.e TT, HT, TH, HH. But there are only 3 bottles, so create a dummy bottle and assign HH to it. Whenever while flipping a coin HH comes, you need to flip it again till a bottle is chosen. This way we can form an infinite GP series.
Opinion on JNU event

Questions asked in PGDBA interview along with your answers.
There were three interviewers on the panel .I was asked to tell me something about myself and what I want to do next (probably an icebreaker). While I was doing that, they read my CV and asked me about my 3-month internship in Taiwan and the work that I did there. Following that up, they asked me about one other project in depth that I did in Physics. (They didn’t ask me about other projects that were mentioned in the CV which were in relevant fields, like Data structures and another one in Analytics). Then came the part around which majority of the interview revolved. The professor in the middle said ,so you are from IIT Delhi. I should assume you have amazing skills in Mathematics.I said you can say that. The professor sitting on the left asked me about double derivatives, maxima-minima, limits, continuity of 4-5 different functions, each time giving a more complex function and tried to test whether I knew what I was saying and asked me to draw a few functions. But the questions were quite basic and he seemed happy with the answers. *Over to the professor in the middle*. He asked me if my degree had a probability course. I told him that it didn’t but I did a course in Probability and Stochastic processes for extra credits in third year. He asked me to write the probability density function, the cumulative density function of exponential distribution and then draw both of them. When I did that, he asked me what a memoryless process is. I told him that the future state of the process depends on the current state of the process and not the past states . He said that is not the description of a memoryless process. I tried to make him understand in a few different ways but he said no. Then the professor wrote a differential equation that I had never seen in my life. He asked me what it was. I could only answer that it was a linear homogeneous differential equation because beyond that I had no idea. He said it is a linear homogeneous differential equation but what is the name of the equation. I looked at it and tried to remember but in vain. Then he said, it must have been taught to you in the first year. I said it wasn’t taught. He said, it is simply impossible. You need to go back home and look at your notes. I couldn’t argue as it would look bad on my part. *Already sinking in my chair* *Over to the professor on the right* He asked me that you have played basketball on a lot of levels as mentioned in your CV, tell me name of one player. I was relieved that he didn’t ask the size of the court or the ball which I had mugged up the previous night.I said Kobe Bryant. He asked who is the greatest player of all time. I said Michael Jordan. He asked me to name one player playing in NBA who is from India. I answered Satnam Singh. Then he asked me to name one player from team India to which I answered Amritpal Singh and the interview was then over.The written test had more weightage as inspite of not performing very well in interviews, I was selected.

Questions asked in PGDBA interview along with your answers.
I don’t remember the exact questions, but they were asked more or less on the same lines.
It was a 3 member panel. I guess they were each from ISI, IIT and IIM (one of them was definitely from ISI) but I am not entirely sure.
First Panelist: Why Data Science?
Me: Sir, I am working on various different things right now like C++, Web development (ASP.net, MySQL, Javascript, Bootstrap and Materialize), Descriptive analytics and I also look after client interaction part for our startup. I want to get a formal and structured training in one discipline and master it. And I have seen the potential of Data Analytics during my work. That is why I want to pursue this course.
Second Panelist: Can you solve this problem?
Me: (It was a problem on limits. It was a tough problem for me) Sir, may I take some time? (He said sure. I tried but I could not solve it.) Sir, I am not able to solve it. But I can guess the answer (and I told him my approach)
Third Panelist: So, Prem you are National Diver?
Me: No, sir International diver. I represented India.
TP: Oh nice. Where did you represent?
Me: 5th AASF Games, Jakarta Indonesia
TP: Okay Prem so tell me the agricultural situation in Maharashtra.
Me: (Told him various crops that are famous in various regions of Maharashtra)
TP: How can you apply data analytics in field of agriculture??
Me: I told him an Image application. He countered me with some problems to my solution. I told him solutions to them (atleast I tried to).
TP: Okay, Prem Thank You.

PGDBA does not check only your technical prowess. It demands your ability to apply the knowledge for Business. And I would say Interview is very very important to demonstrate this ability. So prepare well for the interview if you get the call.

Questions asked in PGDBA interview along with your answers.
My interview started off with the standard tell me about yourself and my well rehearsed answer.With the unimpressive resume that I had, I couldn’t talk about my work experience or academic excellence. Instead, I spoke at length about my personality traits and aptitude that make me a natural fit for analytics and ended with my motivations for joining PGDBA.
Around this time, having gone through my file, one of the interviewers saw that my work experience had not remotely anything to do with analytics or data science and asked my how they tied together.
I admitted that they didn’t, that over the years, I had made some decisions and if I could go back and do it all over again, I would not make the same choices and that, I was looking for a second chance.
Then they asked me how good I was in Mathematics and if I remembered anything from the course ‘Probability and Random Processes’ I had studied in UG. I said that I was above average and optimistically, good and no, I did not remember, but I had been revising some of the concepts. Then they asked me to solve the puzzle on the white board (It was a 4X4 grid where you had to calculate the number of paths from the lower left corner to the top upper corner). I had already come across that before and told them, and solved it on their insistence upon which I was given further cases on the same grid that I was able to solve.
Then, a brief discussion about why I shouldn’t pursue PhD instead of PGDBA ensued (I answered I would, after the course), concluding the interview. The interview time was about 8-10 minutes.
Any suggestion for aspirants regarding preparation for written test and interview.
Studying and practicing +1, +2 NECRT Mathematics books and solving the previous year question papers would suffice for the written test.
About the interviews, they just want to make sure that you are truly interested in the course. Just be honest and explain your motivations for the course.

Questions asked in PGDBA interview along with your answers.
First they asked me make the interview interesting: To this I started telling them about the automotive competition I took part in and then stated my interest about geopolitics for which they asked a couple of questions. I answered all them to the best of my ability.
Then I received some questions on calculus and Fourier series. I don’t quite remember the questions exactly but those questions were all of conceptual type and required a bit of algebraic manipulation.
Then I received certain questions on autonomous vehicles(I stated automobiles as my special interest) about the sensors and workings etc.
So as a whole the interview comprised of 80% questions on calculus and algebra and remaining 20 % on personal interest.
There were no questions on job experience.
Any suggestion for aspirants regarding preparation for written test and interview.
Keep your fundamentals clear on topics such as calculus, linear algebra, and plots of functions.All they are looking for is mathematical aptitude and awareness around the world.
Keep calm and stay focussed. Don’t let yourself get carried away with their facial expression. Be confident about whatever you say.
